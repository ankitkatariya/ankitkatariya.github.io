kinda feel a little dumb that im reporting this but its bothering me so here goes.. bout a month ago i was with a friend and her son, we were hanging out at a camp ground by Allamuchy state park, in Warren county NJ. i think the camp ground was part of Stephens state park either way it was on the Musconetcong river. it was late in the day and we were just walking on the trials by the river. we figured since her son was gonna stay with her folks that evening we would come back later and spend the night at the camp ground. we went home and got together some gear, just sleeping bags and sleeping pads. we stopped at a store got some hotdogs and rolls and a gallon of water then headed to the camp site. it was about 10pm when we got to the camp site and i think we took spot 19. it was close to the road one of the last spots before ya hit the road maybe 50 yards or so. we made a fire in the metal fire ring and just sat around till about 1am, there were maybe 5 or 6 sites that were camped that night one was taken by some boy scouts. at about 1am my friend got in her sleeping bag next to the fire, i was still up drinking hot chocolate and stareing into the fire, about 20min or so later i got into my bag next to her and was lieing on my side looking into the woods. i wasnt comfortable and i laid awake for a good hour or so just thinking and listening to the sounds of the woods and the river that was 100yards tops away from me. then i heard a sound like someone was lightly banging a fork or something against a plate. i thought maybe a bear was snooping around looking for a free meal, this is bear country and we have a very healthy black bear population, but maybe 30 seconds after i heard the metalic sound i heard someone or something bang a branch against a tree 4 or 5 times in a row, i thought that the bear maybe was getting a little to close to someones camp site. then i again heard banging against a tree but this time it was a bout 100yards into the woods and not near any camping area that i had seen in the daylight. then the tree banging came from the first spot as if answering the other position. the first tree banger was what seemed to be on or near the road by the middle of the camp ground. that kinda made my mind wander i was wondering what was going on..and who is up making all this noise. about 10minutes later i looked into the woods which were slightly iluminated by my dieing fire and i saw what looked like a bear looking into my camp about 20 feet away from behind a tree. i saw just the shadowy outline of it. i could see its head and shoulders slowly move out from behind the tree look in and then move back behind the tree. ive seen bears do this before in the day light but never this close. then i closed my eyes waited a few seconds and opened them just to make sure i wasnt seeing things. but this whatever it was had difined shoulders and a rounded kinda pointy on top head, it didnt have and ears like you would see on a bear, nor the flat head of a bear and if it was a bear its front arms wouldnt have given it the squared off shoulders that i was seeing in the silloette of this figure. i got kinda scared for a few moments and didnt move a at all. i thought for a second about jumping up and yelling at it but i didnt want so get it mad at me or scare it. i closed my eyes and tried my hardest just to fall asleep. i dozed off finally and was awoken by my friend who was yelling at me for not putting the bag of hotdogs in the car before going to sleep. we had in the bag a apple and a orange, rolls and a unopend pack of hotdogs, i tied the bag with a simple knot like you would tigh your shoes the night before, but when i got up the only thing left where the bag was, was the orange just sitting there on the ground. my friend said somthing along the lines of wow a bear came and stole our hotdogs. i kinda was wondering what was going on so i decided to have a look around where i saw the figure the night before, i remembered that the shadowy figure was hiding behind the tree and i could see a branch just above its head maybe a foot or so higher than the top of the figure. it was puzzleing because that branch must have been 8 or 9 feet off the ground and black bears where i come from dont stand that tall on there hind feet. i didnt try to tell her what i heard or saw the night before because she wouldnt have belived me anyway, but ive spend lots of time in the back country and woods hunting, fishing, rock climbing, and backpacking. i know what bears look like up close as well as from a distance. and this wasnt a bear and to tall for a person. i didnt smell anything but i think i was up wind anyway and we were burning wood in the fire and all i could really smell was the fire anyway. the thing that really bothers me is the tree banging its was allmost like something was comunicating with something else. it also bothers me that something waited until it was sure that i was asleep before coming into camp. in which case it woulda been 6 or 7 feet from where we were sleeping in order to open the bag and have a look in it, then disguard the orange and take the rest bag and all. it wouldve had to make some sound if it just tore the bag opened. i looked around before we left to see if i could find any tracks or anything but the ground is was just to hard, there was a few game trails but i didnt look very far or spend alot of time looking. i looked on the internet and found this sight and was surprized to see other sitings in new jersey.\", \"location_details\": \"the road

As this creature got closer, my ears and experience told me that this was a biped, only 2 feet crunching through the leaves.  My wife was so freaked out that we had to leave immediately before I could investigate more. Fast Forward to 2006, I was driving to work one night for the 2300 job in East Deerfield, MA.  I remember I was running a little late, so I was probably speeding, and the time would have been 2230ish.  It was raining lightly.  In West Charlemont, at the end of so-called Tea Street Extension, there is a bridge that carries the road over the railroad tracks. This is about 2-3 miles (the way the bird flies) from the encounter above.  What I saw was something standing perfectly still behind the guardrail.

I drive this route almost daily (or nightly, in my case) for over 12 years, I know what belongs and what doesn't.  This did not belong.  I turned around and went back, and it was gone.

It was at that time a very isolated area.  We had apparently disturbed the wildlife in the area as we were always seeing very large black snakes and other wildlife near the house.  I was not prepared, however, for the creature I encountered in the woods behind our home.  I looked up on the thickly wooded hill and saw a huge creature that resembled a gorilla or a bear.  It was dark in color and appeared to be hairy.  It was on the other side of an old fence from me.  I was very frightened. I fled the area immediately.  I wish I could describe this creature better.  I really don't think it was a bear.  Bears are not usually sighted in our area and this creature was really big and it startled me because of it's size.  I don't frighten easily and was accustomed to living in the country with wild animals.  The one thing that does amaze m e when I look back on this incident is that my dog and  pony had no reaction to this creature.  It makes me wonder if they had become accustomed to it coming around when we weren't outside.  I never saw it again but a couple of years later my mother saw something from her kitchen window that looked to her somewhat like a bear but she wasn't sure as she was not close enough to it to see features.  It was on all fours and it got into the nearby stream and walked around the bend and out of sight.  The area where we had these sightings was in Washington Co. MD.  We live near a stream and a thickly wooded area.  The stream feeds into the Conococheague Creek which then feeds into the Potomac River a few miles from our home.  My parents have lived there for 30 years now and there have been no sightings of any creatures such as the ones we observed in the early 1970's.

We had to park on some railroad tracks by the aquaduct and walk through some very dense sticker bushes and overgrowth to find the place. To describe the quarry, it is located in the middle of the woods. It is about 75 yards long and about 30 yards wide with very tall cliffs, about 50 to 80 feet tall in some places. However there are a few places where you can walk down to the waters edge. As we were approaching the quarry, we heard this very loud screeching sound coming from about 25 yards away in the overgrowth. It was very loud and it actually startled us when it first started. The only way to describe the sound would be to say it sounded like a pig getting slaughtered. We stopped walking and waited but it stopped, whatever it was. We continued walking and found the quarry, hearing the strange sound several more times, always coming from a different place. We made a survey and located a place to go down to the waters edge to sit and rest. As we made our way around the quarry we heard the screaming again. Actually coming from the area where we wanted to go! We were not too alarmed though, being curious and stupid. We made it to the waters edge and sat down and started to look around and check the place out. I had picked up a stick off the ground and got out my pocket knife and started to carve on the wood. Suddenly there was a very large splash in the water. It sounded like a person had just jumped in but when I looked up could see ripples in the water where something had gone in. Figuring it was a rock falling from the cliffs we began talking again. About 5 minutes elapsed and we heard another splash. This one bigger and it was very far away from the edge. I asked my freind \\\"Did you throw something in?\\\". He said no, he was looking at me. We looked around to see if anyone was there that we didnt see but there was no one anywhere. We sat for about 5 more minutes talking and then heard another big splash. Neither of us saw what made it but the disturbance in the water was so big we guessed it had to be something big! We started to think that someone was in the woods and didnt want us trespassing and was trying to scare us off. However as we started to really think, we became aware there was no way anyone could throw any rock that big, that far. So we made the choice to go ahead and leave. As we were climbing up and out of the quarry another splash came from very near where we had been sitting and also sounded very big. We reached the top and started to make our way to the car. We only walked about 20 feet when something came crashing through the tree branches and hit the ground near us very hard. It sounded like a 20 pound rock hitting the ground. At that point we both stopped walking and turned and really looked hard into the woods. Neither of us saw anything. As we stood there listening, I swear Ive never heard the woods more quite in my life.  We started to walk again and the objects being thrown at us started to get alot more accurate. I remember saying to my freind \\\"What the hell is going on?\\\" His response was to tell me GO!!! We took off running and reached our only real obsticle, a creek about 10 feet wide where we had to cross on a log. I went first and he was close behind. As we where halfway across the log something landed in the creek about 5 feet from me that had to be the size of a paint bucket. I didnt see if it was a rock or what but it was big. At that point I jumped for it and hit the ground running with my freind right on my tail, neither of us looking back. I have never really felt scared like that, but that day I had the thought that we might meet something that was beyond nature and not live to tell about it. Our journey into the woods took about 30 minutes due to the high growth of pricker bushes, Our journey out took about 3 minutes! We reached the car and the only after the adrenaline wore off did we realize we both were bleeding nicely from running top speed through summer overgrowth. At the time, I didnt know about the connection between the rocks being thrown at us and the screaming to bigfoot, but it sounds like a classic case.

We were all in our late teens but very experienced campers and very comfortable in the woods. On the 2nd night of our trip we made camp in a low area several miles off the trails near where our topographic map showed a Civil War cemetery was located, though we were unable to find the site. After dinner we sat around the fire as the darkness grew and we all began to feel a bit spooked, as if we were being watched, so we let the fire burn itself out and bedded down. Early the next morning I awoke to a loud wailing which I can only describe as a cross between a lion roar and a screech owl. The noise happened several times and it was very close. At the same time we heard something crashing through the vegetation nearby and what sounded like thick branches cracking and heavy thuds as if large logs or rocks were impacting the forest floor. My friend Bryan and I were sleeping in hammocks over which we had suspended rain ponchos. The ponchos were fastened to the hammocks so we would need to untie them in order to get out and we could not see out either. I whispered to Bryan \\\"what was that?\\\". He whispered back \\\"I don't know\\\". That was all we said. I was scared out of my mind and did not dare even move my head to try to see anything as I didn't want to draw attention to myself. I was able to look at my watch and determine it was just after 5am. At that moment I resigned myself to my fate, figuring that if something out there wanted me I would have no chance. I made my peace and waited, eventually drifting back off to sleep. Bryan did not sleep at all after the episode and our 3rd friend, Tom, somehow slept through the whole thing.

Perfect for squirrel hunting, so off I went, not telling anyone where I was going (I had a number of different spots).  I headed for a small woodlot, maybe 10 acres in size, less than a mile from my house.  This woodlot is about 1/3 mile from the nearest road, surrounded by farmland with a small stream on the south side and with several fence rows attached.  It had a farmer\\u2019s lane that went though it in a rough L shape, with a grass and dirt base and large enough to drive on.  Such woodlots are a fairly common feature of the southeastern Michigan farming landscape, if anything the woodlot was smaller than most. The lane enters the woodlot from the north, about \\u00bd mile from the road I first walked onto the lane from.  As I entered the woodlot I noticed something quite odd- there were a large number of birds making a big racquet in the underbrush in the woods just to the right of the lane.  I noticed redwings, robins, jays and cardinals in particular, and they were flirting about the underbrush in a somewhat frenzied fashion.  Many times I had seen redwings gather in large noisy flocks this time of year (pre-migration or corn field raids), but gather high up \\u2013 this was different and struck me as strange.  I continued my way, after 50 yards or so into the woodlot I approached a small bend in the lane where it veers perhaps 20 degrees or so to my right.  My rifle was still slung over my shoulder with a sling, since the hunting spot was on the other side of woodlot near the lane exit on the west side. At the bend in the lane I was still glancing back at the bird commotion, and when I turned my head forward again I froze in shock and terror.  Standing about 25 yards away was a huge furry creature, towering 7 feet into the air and standing just like a man.  It was staring seemly straight through me, and our eyes locked.  It stood in the underbrush just off the left side of trail.  I could not see it below the waist, but could see everything else.  It could see me from head to toe.  We just stared at one another. It was massive, three feet wide at the shoulders, incredibly stocky and strong looking.  Reddish brown hair was everywhere, shorter on the face but perhaps 3-5 inches long on the head and shoulders.  The hair was quite unkempt and mop-like especially on the top of the head.  The head was large, seemingly flat on top.  I could not make out any ears.  Eyes a simple black, no whites, and a lying flat nose without many discernable features \\u2013 there was even some hair there in the middle of the face.  The mouth was large with a bit more hair there, giving the appearance of a sort of mustache.  It did not have much expression, pretty much straight lipped, it really seemed almost relaxed.  Its arms hung at its sides, with the hands in the underbrush.  There were no signs of aggression.  Perhaps that is what kept me from panicking, and neither it nor I moved a muscle.  That eerie stare seemed to last forever.  My mind raced, desperate to escape.  I felt that turning and running might encourage it to chase me, and I knew I could never outpace it.  I did not attempt to unsling my rifle, fearing that it might consider such a move aggressive.  Also, it was only a single shot .22, obviously of little use for something this size.  The rifle was chambered but un-cocked, and if the creature charged I would probably not even have the time to cock it.  I did not want to shoot this creature, but would in self-defense.  So, barely moving my hand that was at my side I could reach back to the bolt knob and try to cock the gun while it was still slung on my shoulder.  I could move the spring a little, trying several times, but from there I could just not get enough leverage to pull it all the way back.  I will never forget how hopeless I felt at that moment.  I had no idea what to do next, and just stood there. Then the creature made its move \\u2013 its large hairy right hand came up, and swiped at a red berried shrub right in front of it.  It moved the hand to its mouth and casually chewed.  It repeated these motions- glancing down to the shrub, swiping up berries and eating, then glancing back up to me.  The arm motion was very fluid and un-human like, no jerking motions, very deft flowing movement.  The left hand remained at the creature\\u2019s side.  It was not picking berries like a person would, it was raking them up.  Also, during the entire encounter I never heard any vocalizations or smelled any odors. Watching it eat, I started to feel better.  I was no longer this creature\\u2019s only concern, so I took this as an invite to leave.  I slowly began to walk backwards, and the creature continued to eat and keep an eye on me.  I slipped around the bend, and lost sight of the creature after a few feet.  I turned around and quickened my pace into a fast walk, not wanting to alert the creature that I was running or in panic.  I continued to look back to the bend in the lane, fearing it would follow.  Soon I was at the woodlot\\u2019s edge, and broke into a full run.  Finally, only to run faster, did I unsling my rifle. I was 15 years old, and it probably did not take me two weeks afterwards to clam up about this for obvious reasons.  In the mid 1990s I told my future wife, and now am reporting it here.

Also, how bad the Lions are in comparison to other teams. As we were driving we noticed a dark object over by the right side road. As we drove closer we could see that it as covered with reddish dark hair. I turned to my friend and we both \\\"Oh wow a bear\\\".

In October of 2003, I as home on leave from Korea (I'm an officer in the Army, currently a Lieutenant Colonel, but at the time of this report I am submitting, a Captain).  My dad and I were planning on doing a lot of bow hunting while I was home and got two areas set up - a bow stand for me and my dad sat in the ground blind he used for rifle season.  The location is near Manistee, Michigan, East of North Custer Rd and North of East Custer Rd.  Over the course of four mornings, we entered the woods approximately one hour before daylight to set in and let things calm down.  The first morning, 11 October 2003, we moved in and split up to our positions.  I was on my stand, settled in, and immediately heard three distinct knocks, from the North of where we were.  Farther North, I heard an answer.  There is a cabin to the West, and I figured it was those guys, as they are usually up on weekends for hunting.  However, the next three mornings, I heard this sound again after we entered the woods, however, the returns changed location, two coming from directly East, and one generally Northeast.  I took this as some sort of signal, but felt it may be the large woodpeckers that are common in the area (except you didn't have the normal rapid drilling/pounding you normally equate to woodpeckers).  However, after seeing \\\"Finding Bigfoot\\\" I now equate these to wood knocks that were signalling our presence.  The sounds ceased after the final morning of knocks.  I returned for solo hunts and again with my dad with no repeat of sounds. In October of 2004, I moved my stand East of where I was hunting into the edge of pines and used this to over watch a trail system.  I had gotten into the stand without incident, was set about an hour after first light (0830) when I heard a garbled sound close to the gibberish heard on Bigfoot sounds and running (North in the pines), when a doe bounded through the pines, stopped 10 yards in front of me breathing heavily, and kept staring North of her.  The gibberish and movement kept coming, then it sounded like a quick sound like \\\"Huh\\\" then silence.  What I then heard was the sound of similar to something sniffing deeply, and then slow movement towards the Northeast and East of me.  As this began, the doe moved quickly past me to the Southwest, eyes really big.  The sniffing ended, but the movement seemed to remain, slow, deliberate movement, but you could hear twigs snap periodically. For two nights after that incident, while in my stand, I felt I was being watched, and circled, hearing slow movement, especially just before dark, to my Northeast and East, then to the South of me, where whatever it was, seemed to be curious, as I was in a stand and not really seen, had shelled corn off the trail for bait, and it knew I was there, knew something was around, but couldn't see me.  It was too loud for a deer, but big enough to be heard.  I had my stand against a big pine, with a larger pine really masking me.

We were near an area where there were alot of berries and were making sure that we didn't stumble upon a bear (which we had done many timees, and let me tell you...this was no bear).  We heard a howling that made the hair on the back of my neck stand up...literally.  ee both hit the deck and reloaded our 12g shotguns with slugs.  Not a word was exchanged.  We were both rather scared.  It was nearing Nightfall, and we had a long way to go to get back to the car.  This is a very rugged and remote area.  The howling was intermittent, but we could hear the animal moving.  It was a couple hundred yards away.  Unfortunately for us it was directly in our path.  This is a swampy lake filled area with heavy growth.  I have travelled all over the world, and this is some of the toughest undergrowth that I have ever seen. We cautiously moved toward the trail (and the animal) and moved a quietly as we could.  We were both experienced woodsman, and we knew this was no Timberwolf, Moose, Bear or cat. We dropped the 3 grouse we had shot as a precaution and contiued along the trail.  Off to our right we heard movement.  I remember being terrified.  It was clear that it was a large creature, but it moved VERY fast.  Faster than any Bull moose I had ever encountered. It followed us on our right flank for a few hundred yards.  It was now approaching dark.  We had lights with us, as well as first aid kits. I turned to my friend and pointed.  At that moment we could see a complete outline of this creature.  The reason it was visible, was that we were in the growth, and it was following, but there was a clearing beind it (an old logging camp area) and the light was still brigh behind it.  We both hit the deck again.  I find it funny that the thought of shooting at it didn't even cross our minds.  We were scared.  I had worked as a wilderness guide, and this was nothing that I had ever seen before.  It walked on 2 feet and stood AT LEAST 7 feet tall.  There was no way to really tell the color (due to the lighting adn our perspective) but it was a dark color.  We continued on our way all the while listening to this thing in the brush following us.  It was amazingly stealthy.  Like I said we were VERY experienced woodsman for our age.  We didn't do drugs or drink like other kids our age...we went hunting and fishing. It finally stopped following us as we crossed a ridge toward a more travelled trail.  We both remember the day like it was yesterday.  We recently spoke of it.

The thumping and moving through the brush went towards the rapids then they quit, I headed that way to see if I could get a glimpse of what it was, but I walked right to where the point hits the rapids, and saw nothing, there are exposed rocks in the water, there was no splashing on any of them, whatever crossed had to leap rock to rock to cross, the first one being about 8 feet from shore,it may be 30 yards wide there. The point is not very big, whatever was there walked very hard on the ground and could not have gone any place else but where I followed it, by sound, like I said it was a dead quiet day, all I could hear was it footsteps and brush moving and water faintly gurgling at the rapids.

When I returned, it was around 11:00 at night somewhere around the first part of October 2000. I parked my truck down next to the barn area and walked up towards the house.  Off to my immediate right I heard this hair raising guttural growl.  My mind was racing...was this one of my nephews bull cows, or was it a deer, but none of those fit anything like that sound. I thought my feet would never get me to the door of the house. This sound was done once again. I finally went in and told my family what I had heard. My son-in-law insisted that it must have been a bear. I have hunted all of my life and know all of the animal sounds, including a bear. The next morning I called the Conservation office, and they put a gentleman on the phone and I related to him what had happened. I even made a similance of the sound the best I could. He said that he and his wife go to Alaska all the time to study bear and he had never heard anything like that and it definitely wasn't a bear. The next night, my other daughter and I were upstairs getting ready for bed around 11:00 p.m again and had the windows open. I heard the same sound again out my bedroom window. I quickly turned out the lights, and my daughter crawled from her room to mine to see if she could also hear it. By then, the sound had stopped. Several days later in the eveming, my grandaughter, grandson, and I believe another grandson were playing outside the garage door which was raised up about 3 feet. They heard this loud guttural sound also very close to the same place I had heard it originally and rolled under the garage door as fast as possible. Since that time, several of my family have had some very scary encounters with this sound near their houses. We live in a very wooded cedar and hardwood area with a year round creek. I would like to relate all of these incidents, but they are fairly numerous. I would be glad to tell you, and introduce you to the ones who have had these various experiences. These creatures have lived in this area for many years. My youngest son who is in college now, was out hunting with his friend. They were both about 11 years old at the time, and were hunting up a powerline when they saw what they thought was person, but realized it had hair on it like a gorilla, and it was shaking a fairly good sized cedar tree, which we assume it was trying to shake something out of it.

looking for buck sign and squirrel hunting.Mainly looking for rubs and scrapes for deer hunting the upcoming season.I was on a hillside overlooking a steep canyon in rough country on the bryant creek watershed.I sit for a spell and was watching the other hillside.I was carrying a browning bottom eject 22 rifle and had planned to harvest squirrels but had passed on several in hope of not alarming deer in the area..I saw a flicker of movement on the adjecent hillside about 150 yds distance.I unlooped my Nikon binoculars from around my neck and looked over where I saw the leaves move.Even though it was late october and a cool morning it hadnt frosted yet and the leaves were mostly green.What I saw was a small sapling move.I saw black fur probably a foot sized patch through the foliage.It was standing still at this point.I thought bear or maybe a cow and was unconcerned.It finally took a few steps and I gasped when I realized it was a upright animal and covered in black fur.It was a dusky black and not shiny.It was moving parallel on the hill and angling somewhat upwards.Id say I watched it for about 10 mins and had never fuly got a look at it even through the binoculars but it finaly hit a small vehicle sized opening and It hit me I was actually watching a bigfoot.It was feeding on something on the ground I believe wild grapes that had fell out of a tree that had vines in it or maybe acorns.It would occasionally look up and listen.A car went down the highway about a half mile in the distance and it looked up and was canting its head to listen.I believe if the car had turned down the gravel road towards us it would have fled.It was only when the car went quiet a ways down the road it continued to feed.It was very large probably 7 foot plus and very broad shouldered.It elbows wasnt like humans it was pointed and stuck back like a deers front leg even when relaxed.It had a crown or slight dome on top its head.A dusky charcoal black with silver beginning at the back of the head and a ridge of fur beginning to get thicker there and widening as it came down the back.The hairs in the elbows and down the back of the leg was longer and the stripe of heavier hair down the head and back was silver tipped.It was somewhat pot bellied but not really.The upper body was absolutely massive.I wouldnt hesitate to say the animal weighed 400 lbs in the least.The nose must have been flat because it didnt make but maybe a half inch bump on its face and I couldnt see any ears at that time...The thumb on its had were more chimp like.Higher on the hand and longer.I think it had 5 fingers and there had no hair on the palms.the hairs were more tapered like claws not human fingernails.It only looked across the valley where I was one time and its eyes were brown and animal like large pupils.It hair up to its lower eyes and a wide mouth.Not much in the way or a chin and its forehead was lined deeply.I was using Nikon zoom binoculars that had 7-15x40 power and was able to see a lot of details.I kept wishing for a camera...After viewing it for Id say 15 mins I heard a vocalization very soft from higher on the hill.I never saw what made it and since I only barely caught it couldnt say how it sounded.But the bigfoot looked that way and stood up and made a return sound that almost sounded like too pieces of hard steel rod banged together.Kind of a ping sound and it walked that way.It had no tail and was very broad across the shoulders.I believe these are a unique species and are pure animal.Not in anyway related to humans.However I think their senses like smell and hearing,eyesight are very acute and they have a lot of intelligence thats why people never see them hardly.They dont want to be seen and avoid encounter with man.Never saw one before and never since.But I dont go into the woods before daylight anymore.I wait till I can see.And if mushroom hunting or looking for indian relics I carry a heavy caliber pistol.I wouldnt want the tangle with one

gone into town for camping supplies. It was the second week in November, and I was deer hunting with my family (Mom, Dad, & little Brother), and two close family friends in the Mark Twain National Forest approximately 7 miles south of Cabool, Mo. in Douglas County, Mo. My Mom, Dad, & little Brother had gone into town for supplies just after sundown, and left myself, and the two friends (Shawn & Dennis) at the camp site. Shortly after dark, we were all three sitting around the campfire, and heard what we thought was a deer rubbing its antlers. We got up and snuck back behind the tents in the direction of the sound.  We did not have any light source with us except for the camp fire light behind us. The conditions were partly cloudy, and moonlit. Visibility was really good. As we approached the area, what we immediately recognized to be a Bigfoot stepped out from behind a tree. My friend Shawn was 6'8\\\" and he had to physically lift his head to look at the creature's face. We instantly turned and ran back to our camp where our deer rifles were.The people in the camp next to us fired one shot into the darkness, and was yelling to get their things packed as we ran to the our camp site.  We grabbed our guns, reloaded them, and began piling more wood on our fire. We had three lanterns in camp, so I was elected to take them out into the woods just outside of our campsite on all sides to allow for better vision. We then all sat with our backs to the fire, and our guns in our laps. We began to hear heavy footsteps in multiple directions, and then we started seeing either four of five of these things circling our camp. There was one that was positioned just on the other side of the dirt road that was pacing back and forth, and stopping to squat down and stare for a moment. After approximately 45 minutes of being circled and watched, but never approached in any way, my parents returned. They were immediately concerned about the ENORMOUS size of our fire. We quickly explained what was happening, and my dad decided we should go stay in town for the night. While we were extinguishing the fire, the campers next to us made a hasty exit out of the woods. We grabbed a change of clothes and went to a motel for the night. The next morning, when we returned to camp, nothing had been touched at all. Everything was just as we had left it, including a deer hanging in a tree which Shawn had harvested the day before. My Dad gave us the option of going home, or staying to continue hunting. We chose to stay under the conditions that everybody hunted close to camp for a while. I decided to hunt back behind our camp, where the first sighting occurred the night before. I sat down on a sharp ridge overlooking a very deep, very steep valley. I hadn't been sitting there more than 10 minutes, when I saw a bigfoot ascending the steep slope on the other side of the valley. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I raised my rifle to view it through my scope, and as I watched it negotiate very treacherous terrain with ease, it turned and looked directly at me, grabbed a live tree approximately 5\\\" in diameter, and broke it in half with one hand. It then turned and disappeared over the top of the far ridge. I hurried back to camp to tell the others, and we went to the spot where I had seen it, and next to the broken tree was a print that appeared almost human-like. Shawn placed his size 16 hunting boot inside the track, and there was a margin of space around his boot of approximately an inch to an inch and a half.\", \"location_details\": \"Due south  apprx. 15 to 20 miles of Cabool on Hwy.181 just past the county line of Texas and Douglas Co.\", \"county\": \"Douglas County\", \"state\": \"Missouri\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 40087: Man recalls encounters while camping with his hunting party south of Cabool\", \"latitude\": 37.02496, \"longitude\": -92.11988, \"date\": \"1982-11-15\", \"number\": 40087.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9yw6xu0q50\", \"temperature_high\": 38.77, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": 0.07, \"moon_phase\": 0.01, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"snow\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy in the evening.\", \"uv_index\": 3.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 215.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.57, \"location\": \"POINT(-92.11988000000001 37.02496)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was staying all night at my friend's house located off of KK Highway in Douglas County, Missouri.  This particular friend just lived a couple of miles from my home. She had told me about how she had heard loud, \\\"puppy-like\\\" howling noises, and how she always felt like she was being followed when she went on walks in the woods that surround her home.  She smoked, and said that when she was out on these walks she would at times hear something walking behind her, but when she lit her cigarette, the sounds seemed to stop.  Well, being fifteen and stupid at the time, I came up with this idea to go find what ever it was.  I thought that whatever it was had to be scared of fire, due to her whole cigarette analysis.  So, we took some hay from their barn and put it in paper bags.  We put the bags on the ends of thick branches that we found to make these so-called \\\"torches\\\".  I secured the bag to the branch on one of these torches with my belt.  So the adventure began.  We headed across their field toward the woods.  It was dusk at the time.  The field was about the one and a half lengths of a football field (I am not into sports, so I cannot really tell you actual feet).  When we reached the edge of the woods, which is where the family dumped some trash, we looked at each other and decided this was not such a bright idea.  We turned around and headed back to the house.  When we were around midway through the field something big and grey came darting toward us from the edge of the woods.  The distance between us and it was probably around 200 feet.  I took off running, without even telling my friend what I was running from; thankfully she followed.  I didn't even realize I still had those torches in my hands, which I finally dropped when we reached the area of the barn, which was about 100 feet from the house.  We ran into the house and stayed there for about 15 minutes, while I tried to fill her in about what I saw.  After we got enough courage up, we went outside again.  We could see about midway into the field a large, grey-colored, ape-like creature squatting down in the brush of the field.  It was just squatting there looking at us.  That was enough, and back into the house we went.  That night, we heard all kinds of commotion outside.  The next morning I had realized my belt was still out there by the barn.  when we went to get it, we found the torches ripped to shreds.  My belt had been torn into pieces, with teeth marks all over the leather clasp.  There were dents knocked into an old car the family had parked in the field.  Later, my friend told me that a little red wagon that was dumped in the dump site was bent in half.  Every time I stayed all night with this friend, whatever it was acted up with this type of behavior.  My friend actually had a calf that died with its neck broken and twisted all the way around after I had stayed the night.  I told my parents about this, and my dad actually wanted to go hunt whatever it was.  I haven't told a lot of people about this, because of fear that no one would believe me.  I go camping sometimes, and I am still very alert to my surroundings to this day, because I never want to see another one for the rest of my life.\", \"location_details\": \"Western Douglas County, just west off KK Highway.\", \"county\": \"Douglas County\", \"state\": \"Missouri\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 18442: Memory told of being chased on a farm near Ava\", \"latitude\": 36.94109, \"longitude\": -92.7622, \"date\": \"1986-08-14\", \"number\": 18442.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9yw41hutkn\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-92.7622 36.94109)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Overview: Dates - Oct. 17 -20, 2002 Location - Douglas County, MO near Dora, MO - Mark Twain National Forest Campground off CC Highway, North Fork, Campsite #20 (Pine loop). Evidence - Loud calls, rock/boulder throwing, footprints, displaced log in middle of lower trail, multiple incidents. Witnesses - Myself and camping partner, Carl. No other campers were in the entire park on 10/17/02. Incident #1 10/17/02 approx 7:30-8:00 PM After eating dinner my camping partner and I were sitting in front of the large camp fire facing the stream (North Fork of the White river). It was an extremely quiet night. No crickets, or locusts or frogs/toads could be heard at all. It was very quite. We were talking and listening to music. Over the music I heard an animalistic sounding call out of my right ear. I heard it twice before I asked Carl if he heard it. To me it sounded about 150 - 200 yards away, upstream and on the opposite side of the stream up on the bluffs over looking the stream. He said, \\\"I hear something\\\". I jumped up and turned off the music. Immediately after turning off the music we both heard a similar call from downstream approximately 50-100 yards away. It sounded as though it was coming from the upper path running parallel to the stream. The campsite (#20 - Pine Loop) was unique as it was created in the middle of the upper trail. In other words, someone walking the trail would actually walk right in the middle of the campsite. The call was very unusual. It sounded initially somewhat canine. When I first heard the second call I was unsure of my original impression of the first call coming from upstream. Carl and I are both avid outdoor/camping enthusiasts. Carl 50-60 years old and has been an outdoorsman most of his life. I am 30-40 years old and have been camping many times as a child, with Carl twice per year for the last 10 years, and with my own family. We have both heard many identifiable animal calls while in the forest. This was an animal call that was unlike anything we had ever heard, or seen on any documentary or while camping. To describe the sound this animal made is difficult. It began the call as a canine type \\\"howl\\\" followed by a \\\"whoop\\\" or \\\"bark\\\" repeated several times. This was NOT a coyote or wolf. The pitch was much deeper and tonal quality gave the impression of something larger than a coyote or wolf. The animal made 2-3 of these \\\"howl/whoops\\\" and then was silent. During the silence Carl and I speculated as to the source. We immediately ruled out coyote and wolf as we had both heard those animals in the past. We heard no movement of the animal during the silence - but we were talking/whispering to each other and could have missed any movement sounds. 30-45 seconds after the downstream calls, what we believed to be the same animal let out a call the truly defies description. The animal was now almost directly in front of us if not slightly downstream. The sound appeared to come from the lower path running parallel to the stream just in front of us. This would make the animal approx 35 yards away between the campsite and the stream. The call was another \\\"howl/whoop\\\" combination repeated 2-3 times. It was so loud that the echo from behind me was almost equal to the original sound in volume. It was a \\\"blood curdling\\\" call. Clearly the animal was either posturing or warning us. I felt the call was directed specifically to us. The call was almost human - but would have had to be a very large tall human. The depth and volume of the call indicated to me an animal of a minimum of 150 - 200 pounds. For the first time in my 38 years, an animal call triggered my \\\"fight or flight response\\\". I immediately picked up a large knife and felt an almost over-whelming urge to loudly scream back into the darkness and to rush toward the sound. My adrenaline was pumping. I said to Carl that I felt the sound resembled a large human imitating a wolf. That the call was very \\\"exaggerated\\\" and was clearly meant to scare us. We speculated that someone might be playing a hoax on us. Carl responded that he felt this was a close description of the sound. Just as he said those words, not more than 5 seconds after the end of the loud call in front of us, we heard a second animal make the SAME call from 150 yeards or so UPSTREAM. When we heard the second animal make an identical call, we knew we were not dealing with a human prank. I am a musician. The second animal was not a human being. The second animal's tonal characteristics and depth matched the first animals almost identically. We humans have such different voices. I would have been able to differentiate the two human voices from each other if it was a prank. When we heard the second animal we knew we were hearing something neither of us could explain. It was NOT human, it was NOT a coyote or wolf, it could not be explained. The second animal seemed to be giving it's location to the first. The first animal seemed \\\"male\\\" or parental. The second animal seemed \\\"female\\\". Within 30 seconds, The first animal seemed to have moved from in front of us and was now approx 75 -100 yards upstream and on the opposite bank where it met up with the second animal. Both animals then gave 2-3 howling/whoops. Immediately following both animals began a series of completely different sounds. These were very spooky sounding. The sounds were very fast, gutteral and rising and falling in pitch. It sounded like a language to me. It sounded as though they were having a very emotional verbal argument. It was almost like a cross between a gorilla's grunt and a witch's cackle. Then it sounded as if both animals ran further up stream and over the bluff. The enitre series of calls lasted approximately 5-7 minutes. Incident #2 10/17/02 approx 9:45 -10:00 PM. I had gone into the tent to sleep at approx 9:30. Carl followed a little later - approx 10-15 minutes. Immediately after Carl entered the tent we heard one animal make the same \\\"howl/whoop\\\" combination 2-3 times and then silence. It appeared to come from the upstream direction about 100-150 yards away. Incident #3 10/18/02 appox 02:00 AM I was awakened by a very loud crashing sound. I heard the sound 2-3 times before I woke Carl up. The sound appeared to some from slightly upstream - maybe 20 yeards or less. The sound was VERY loud. It sounded as if very LARGE (minimum of 20 pound - possibly 100 pound or greater) boulders were being purposely thrown in the stream. The boulders were so large that the sound had to parts. The first was the object hitting the water, the second was the object hitting the river bed itself. It was a \\\"Splat-boom Boom\\\" cannon type sound. Carl had been snoring loudly (as do I) prior to waking up. This sound happened at least 12 times over a 5 minute period. I stated to Carl - \\\"This shows intelligence and strength\\\". I believe it was still trying to scare us off. Immediately after the last boulder impact we heard one of two animals make a very brief \\\"howl/whoop\\\" (1-2 times). It was as if the animal wanted to place his signature on the boulder throwing. Incident #4 10/18/02 While exploring the lower path 20 yards from our campsite, Carl discovered a large log blocking the path. This water soaked log was completely out of place. It did not come from any surrounding trees. When I attempted to pick it up it crumbled in my grasp. We did not see the log on the path on 10/17/02 - however it was dark and we could have missed it. It appeared to also be a \\\"message\\\" - as though something wanted to block our path downstream. Incident #5 10/19/02 10:00 AM While walking on the upper path downstream approx 40-75 yards from our campsite, Carl and I found 2 foot prints. They were approx 14 inches in length. The heel and ball of the print appeared very human like - very similar to \\\"Big Foot\\\" prints and casts I have seen in various medias. However, the toes were very different. The clearest print showed this to be a THREE-TOED Creature. I am NOT CRAZY. I could not believe only three toes. The toes were very human if not \\\"pod-like\\\" in appearance. We took several pictures of the clearest print. We did not have the materials to make a cast. Carl felt the print might not even lend itself to casting. We did get several pictures of the prints. We could not identify any other charateristics from the prints. I will say this - as with the loudest call from directly in front of us - I believe whatever made these prints is very large. A minimum of 6.5 feet tall and 250 pounds. More likely my \\\"instincts\\\" tell me it is 7-8 foot tall and 350-500 pounds. It appeared from the angle of the prints that the animal came down the trail and was alarmed/suprised/angry to see our camp blocking the middle of the trail. The trail was hard packed and yielded no prints. The prints found were just off the side of the trail and in very soft and somewhat wet soil.  Incident #6 Unlike the evening of 10/17/02. The evening of 10/18 and 10/19 brought scattered rain showers. Depsite the rain, the forest was NOT eerily quiet as it was on 10/17. Crickets, frogs, etc. were very loud on 10/18 and 10/19.

My mother was napping, my father was at work (he helped farm there on the land--they lived in a trailer on the about 350 acres owned by their landlord). I was sitting on the front porch with my son and my parent's dog, Buddy. It was mid-afternoon, probably between 1 and 3 pm. I noticed something or someone walking in the field connected to the front yard coming in our direction. My first instinct was to get my baby and get inside. However, I could not help but stand in the doorway, screen door closed but the wooden door open just enough for me to peer through. Whatever that thing was, it kept coming closer to the trailer. By this time, Buddy (the dog) was timidly barking. I could tell from his bark that he was threatened but afraid. I felt bad leaving the dog out on the porch alone, but was too afraid to go out there. The thing (for lack of a known word to call what it was that I saw)was walking, on two legs, aimlessly, not in a hurry and I could not find a reason as to why it came into the yard as it was just looking around aimlessly and leisurely walking. There was a wooden fence, mostly for decoration and only about 20 feet long, that the thing walked next to. My mother had some decorations (can't remember what) hanging on the fence that the thing seemed to look at. The dog barking did not startle the creature, it just kept walking. I was absolutely astounded by what I was seeing; if not for the fact that the dog was seeing it too, I would have wondered if my eyes and/or brain was playing tricks on me. I decided to be brave and opened the screen door just enough to stick my head outside. That's when the thing looked at me, met my gaze. I just stood there, half afraid of it's reaction and it's next move but more curious than anything. My heart was racing. I held my son up to look at it also, still indoors. After it looked at me and yet showed no fear I had more time to study it and I was racking my brain to identify what it was that I was seeing. Here is the best description I can give...It was between 4-6 feet tall, walking on two legs, covered from head to toe in very long white hair. It's face was mostly covered in white hair as well, except for it's eyes and maybe it's mouth. It did not have the snout like a dog, it's shape and build was that of a human's. I even compared it to a bear in my head, but their were not enough similarities. This thing was not very animalistic in behavior--the way it walked and looked at me were more typical of human behaviors. Yet, the way it wandered and seemed oblivious to the man-made things around it (cars, the trailer, even the fence) was more like the characteristics of an animal. I did not get the feeling that it was aggressive or wanting to cause harm. Yet, because of the size and animalistic nature of it, I knew that it was strong and could hurt me, my son, or the dog. It began to walk around the side of the garage, out of my sight, but closer towards the end of the trailer that had the bedroom my mom was napping in. I ran down into the bedroom and began frantically looking out the windows searching to see where it had gone. i woke my mother up in my tizzy and quickly told her what I had seen and I wanted her to look. She was still half-asleep and slow to process what I was saying. I did not see where it went from there. I could not locate it through the windows and I was much too afraid to go outside and look. My mom, my son, and I all sat and talked about what I had seen that afternoon. I was still shook up about it. My son was able to confirm to my mother that it was not a dog, not a bear. The fact that we both saw and heard that dog barking at it helped to convince my mom that it wasn't a human or another dog, bear, etc. My mom said that people down the road have two big white dogs--but like I told her, this thing was walking on two legs, not on all fours like a dog. For many other reasons, I knew it was not a dog. I'd never seen a bear in real life before, but I am sure it was not a bear either. I had heard of and seen animated Yetis on a pc game before. That was the closest thing I could match to what I had seen. I knew then and know now that many people do not believe Yetis are real--but whatever it was that I saw that day makes me wonder if they are in fact real and if that is what I saw. I believe it was late summer when this happened. Nice weather, sunny day. Like I said, mid-afternoon and it was out in the open. There were clear farmlands all around us. One pond stocked with fish and swans right next to the end of the trailer that it went in the direction of. There were also two other ponds on the land. I know that a lot of the 350 acres was wooded. Also, there was a road about 300 feet from where the thing was and also from where I was. There was only about 150 feet between myself and the creature. I'm not good at mathematical estimations, but I was as close as I would have wanted to be to whatever that was. It looked as if it could have made about 10 strides to me in a very short amount of time, so I stayed inside. I've read a few of the other sightings here on your sight, but all that I have read are of people seeing creatures covered in dark brown or almost black long hair. That wasn't the case with me. The description of the hair being that it was very long and covered the whole creature, not tangled, matted, or dissarrayed, but it was a blinding white color--didn't even look dirty or yellowed. I wish I could remember its hands or feet, but I can't. I can say that it's eyes were bigger than that of a human's and seemed very dark. Other than when we met each other's gaze, it had it's head looking down so I could not see it's eyes or facial features well if at all. It did not make any noises at all. It hardly made any sounds while walking. This happened about 5 years ago and I have not forgotten it--never will forget it. In fact, my son still remembers seeing it as well. I told my dad about it when he got home--he couldn't tell me what it was either, had not seen anything like that before. I've told my husband, my brother, some friends--no one can relate to what I saw or help me to name what it was. I often wish I could go back to that day and be less afraid and more willing to study it, to even sit outside and watch it instead of hiding inside. I doubt I will ever see anything like that again, and yet I don't know if I really want to, lol. I hope this helps with your work in some way. I had no idea that there have been so many sightings of similar creatures in Missouri and in our country as a whole. I'm going to look through some more stories of sightings after I submit this--I'm curious to see if anyone else has reported a white creature before. It feels great to share my story with someone who might be able to tell me what it was that I saw that day--someone who might have seen something like this before themselves.

No previous experience with Sasquatch or similar, but have seen a couple shows on television (1 episode of finding BF, and one episode of Survivorman). The Survivorman version was more honest in the \\u201cI don\\u2019t know what that was\\u201d category and peeked my interest; later reminded me of the structure I saw on the ravine trail here.  I have many years camping experience, and some deer and turkey hunting, and grew up summers playing Dan\\u2019l Boone in the woods, so I am pretty comfortable in the woods normally.  After this, I really have no interest in chasing BF \\u2013 but would go there again only if I had a few capable buddies together for security.  On August 31st, I went on a solo backpacking trip on the Wilderness Trail at Meramec State Park in eastern Missouri.  The trail traversed a ~10 mile loop through the ~7,000 acres of protected wilderness with backpack campsites scattered along the exterior circumference of the loop.  I started at the main trailhead at the MSP Cabins parking lot, traveling counterclockwise along the route.  I was on the trail at 4PM sharp, a sunny day with chance of evening thunderstorms, highs in the mid 80s.  Trail goes through a heavily forested area, typical Eastern white oak, hickory, with understory trees and shrubs, poison oak, etc.  \\u2013 significant areas of the trail were overgrown and thick annual weedy undergrowth, and many creek crossings (soil is moist under the rocks, but almost no areas with clean free-flowing water).  After fifty yards or so there is a trail-use sign-in box; the box was pretty full of hiker slips so I gathered the rangers do not check it often.  Heading clockwise, campsites 1&2 are about \\u00bd mile in, and about 3.5 miles are campsites 3&4.  I ran into two people (day hikers) on their way out near the sign-in box.  Human sign became very thin after \\u00bd a mile, and zero footprints or any human sign after the backpacking camp 2.  I was very much alone after that, and evident with the thick weedy overgrowth (thought path was visible nearly always).  As campsites 1&2 were in a hollow that was muddy & buggy I kept going to campsite 4, which was on high ground with much of the undergrowth removed, and excellent visibility.  No sign of large mammal life save one whitetail deer buck I scared about 1 mile short of campsite 3.  The site looked like it had not been used for a year.  No footprints, disturbed anything, and the piles of logs were pretty covered in fungus.  I decided to go a bit further on the trail looking for fresh water before doubling back to make camp; I was a running a little low on water to enjoy lots of drinks.  After campsite 4, the trail heads steeply down into a ravine following a creek (the creek head is more or less at camp 4).  Going down 150 yards or so down the trail in the ravine, its gets very dark and overgrown, and I got a sudden creepy feeling I was being watched, and I kept halting to listen as I may have been hearing echoes of my own pack squeaking.  Trust your instincts.  Not finding water, and the creepy feeling getting much worse, I turned around heading back up to make do with the water I brought in.  Half way back up I noticed I had earlier walked right by a very strange \\u201cstructure\\u201d formed out of 3-6\\u201d thick trees bent and broken about 6-12 feet off the ground.  They were all bent inward towards each other from different directions, still with green leaves, and no other trees around showing wind stress or damage, and this being in a protected ravine, it made no sense.  I\\u2019ve never seen it like that before, except maybe where one tree felled another, but not bent and broken midway up the trunk.  Besides, there was no big fell-tree in sight.  I shot a few quick pictures with my iPhone and quickly headed up to camp.  Seems safer there being open and with a homey firepit, and a four-square around it of linearly-laid logs etc.  After dinner, I went to bed about 9.  The sleep setup is a camping hammock between trees maybe 30-35\\u2019 from the fire, a bugnet bag surrounding the hammock (dark mesh also affords privacy), and a taught inverted V-shaped tarp over all in case it rains.  I was just getting settled and then endless noises started.  Noises I could not identify for the most part.  Around 9:30PM, it was nearly pitch black with occasional wind gusts very high at the top of trees.  Below me towards the deep woods ravine: and then two loud knocks in quick succession.  I recall how loud, close, and how musical they were, not dull bark on bark, but like a baseball bat against a oak tree, or like the sound wood makes when it is being split by an axe.  But nobody could swing an axe that fast, or just make two swings, much less there was no one within miles.  The knocks were followed by sticks breaking underfoot, and then a loud snort or two like a big deer or horse maybe 20\\u2019 from my hammock.  I was frozen to move.  Then someone shook my tarp very quick.  I shone my light and saw nothing (but difficult to get good beam through the bug net).  Maybe \\u00bd hour later the sound of a rock landing and loudly clacking against other rocks in a dry creek 25\\u2019 behind me, and something plucked one of the strings on my hammock or tarp (boinnnnng).  Man, something was right there.  Again a quick look to catch something and I could see nothing with my flashlight \\u2013 but the beam only went about 8 feet at most through the bugnet.  At this point and the rest of the night my heart was pounding, and I was praying for rain to make the things go home. A while later, up on the ridge where the single knock came from, a loud ugly animal scream  - maybe six in a row (like a fox makes, but deeper).  At some point I swear someone was messing with a stick on the fire, the coals moved around like someone threw something at them again and again.  I got an impression this was like kids playing around or something.  At the same time, for at least two hours, the constant sound maybe 30-40 feet away of someone walking around quietly and picking through a rotten log or removing bark from a tree.  Like looking for grubs or ?? There aren\\u2019t any woodpeckers a 2 AM \\u2013 right?  Also, I was surprised that no whiporwhills, chuck-will\\u2019s-widow or other birds were making noise.  Come to think of it, no owls either.  Very quiet except for these \\u201cthings\\u201d.  The log chipper was flinging bits and pieces \\u2013 like small twigs landing on my tarp over and over, but would stop if I shone the flashlight.  The whole thing was like someone messing with me having fun.  I sat motionless. But more of the same went on and on.  I did get the impression someone was more curious and insistent then going to eat me.  By then I had my machete, knife, and flashlight in the hammock with me \\u2026 but I am a small man. I lost track of what came before what between about 1 and 3, but this went on all night until about 4AM.  Around 2, I heard a fluttering sound about the hammock and tarp (like someone blowing several loose raspberries with their lips bbbbfppppt, and flicking the tarp with their fingers).  This was really annoying.  At some point around 3, I fell asleep exhausted, but awoke to the sound of a dog\\u2019s collar tags coming closer jing-jing-JING-JING getting louder and closer \\u2013 Thank heavens, a dog to chase them away!  But I yelled Hey!, and it stopped instantly. But I found there was no dog, and instead it was my zipper pulls jingling together \\u2026 someone had been flicking and jingling them only 2 feet from my head.  Later I swear I heard people talking, a woman in a casual conversational tone, like someone hiking to camp (again felt great relief.  But who would be hiking to camp at 2 AM, and it stopped suddenly and nobody was here \\u2013 plus no lights of course.  I hear her again, and then nothing.  Could not make out any words (at one point I thought maybe someone in the woods was messing with me), but there was no one there and no footprints or otherwise noises that people make.  Whatever these things were, they were fast and deadly quiet when they wanted to be.  Occasionally sticks breaking underfoot, or grunts, but not much.   I\\u2019ve heard deer breaking sticks underfoot, and grunting, so it wasn\\u2019t hugely different from that \\u2013 but this is 2-3AM, and kept coming back and they would not do it sniffing around a person\\u2019s hammock.  I remember a few other things up on the hill behind me.  At some point lot of loud wood cracking \\u2013 trees being broken or pushed over.  But I don\\u2019t recall hearing the thump of them hitting the ground.  Also, in the great distance over the hill outside the park was some kind of a red-neck rodeo with the sound of jeeps and four-wheelers zooming around, and a few distant trains & whistles.  At one point dogs barking very far away back there, - possibly at the red-neck party but they didn\\u2019t bark long just a few times (not a coon hunt), and I recall that really upset whatever it was below me in the woods.  I don\\u2019t recall what they did in response, but I made a mental note that they became very agitated at the sound of dogs (possibly just lots of stick breaking).  During a quiet spell, I\\u2019d had enough and chanced it to out go pee.  I didn\\u2019t see anything, but did find one sock was missing from my boot.  Thinking a raccoon got it, and thinking about hiking back with one sock was memorial (funny and annoying at same time).  But the next morning my sock was back, thrown more or less where it should have been. It is possible I was so tired that I just missed the sock in the night, but I\\u2019m not sure.  Again, messing with me.  Later I woke to some scratching on my backpack like someone checking it out (the backpack was right behind my head leaning up against the hammock suspension tree) and then that started plucking at my hammock guy-wire.  With a quick flash of the light it stopped and \\u2013 nothing.  It was hard to see directly behind me, but no Raccoon either and they always move from people and light.  Either way, in the morning, nothing at all messed with my pack, sweaty clothes still sitting on my pack, or my food bag set 50 feet away \\u2013 all pristine and untouched.  Very late, maybe 4AM, I hear the scream on the hill again, but this time Much deeper voiced.  Maybe a combination bark and scream.  This one really scared me as it sounded like a huge dangerous daddy.  But nothing happened.  Lastly, I heard the most ghostly howling below me.  Quiet at first, but ghostly, with lots of air and echo, like the way a person would tell a campfire ghost story making a ghost howl, starting high and moving the ghostly echo tone gently lower and lower through all the minor notes.  The long ghostly howl ran twice, then it was over.  I almost laughed as it sounded so fake, and ridiculous after such a long crazy night.  Almost like the Matriarch calling everyone home down the hill now that big daddy was back, and time to go to bed.  In the morning, the rain finally came between 6-8AM, I ran out to cover my clothes and batten-down the tarp and was grateful for the peace under the tarp.  Packing up and leaving between 8-9, I noticed a few other things of note, but cannot tell if they were associated, unrelated, or my tired head. 1. The tarp was last to take down.  Shaking all the rain off, I noticed an extremely dark shape in the open woods back above me and facing me.  Black like nothing else.  Set very low, I thought it might be a huge dark gall on the side of a tree trunk 75 yards away.  I moved around a bit and it did not move or change, so I assumed just a gall that got wet.  In hindsight, there was definitely something about that thing that wasn\\u2019t right and got my attention so raptly.  Maybe about the size of a crouching adult person, but fatter and shorter. 2. One of the logs next to the fire had been severely gouged out with bits and pieces pulled out.  But after the torrential downpour in the morning, hard to say when that was done.  But not real long ago as they were colored bits.  I might have a photo of it by accident when I took some last shots of the camp, I can look. 3. On the hill above me, it seemed odd that so many large trees (entire trunks), were laid down in linear piles.  Like piles of 6-10 trees on top of another all on the same direction.  Could have been a logging operation, but there was no logical arrangement of the piles to each other, and no road anyway.  That was another spot that was compelling to check out, but I did not feel comfortable going up there to investigate at all. 4. I looked over the small dry creek bed behind me for heavy deer footprints but I could not find any to explain the huge ruckus all night, and the snorting next to me, and the stone clacking in that area.  But it did rain. 5. About 2/3 mile from the exit on the way out, just before the spur to camps 1 & 2, I heard a crash a large limb falling down and hit the ground just maybe 15 feet off the trail to my left.  Pretty close.  Of course hiking I\\u2019m looking mostly towards the ground/trail, not up.  A bit startling, but not totally unexpected if we had a downpour and storm in the morning.  But I heard buzzing nearby, and my feet moved before I knew it (having experienced yellow-jacket nests in the wild before).  50 feet away looking back and I saw that the crashed tree/stick or whatever, had a hornets nest on it and the hornets were making a small black cloud.  Fortunately they hung around the nest area being also confused, I took a picture from a distance and got out of there.  In hindsight, could something have really been trying to send me a message to never come back?  Perhaps I\\u2019m over-thinking it.  I was out by 11AM and in a daze for a few days after that\\u2026 Of all the sounds, the deep cry of big-daddy and the creepy ghost howl bothered me the most.  That or the thing shaking and plucking at my tarp guy lines, jingling my sipper pulls over my head,  and tossing rocks and sticks at me.  I could not explain those at all.   The grunts and first set of screams\\u2026 could be other animals like foxes, huge deer, a bat fluttering under the tarp\\u2026 well, maybe, but given all this, it\\u2019d have to be grand central station for the zoo. \", \"location_details\": \"Meramec State Park, Missouri.

The first time was on a night time coon hunt. I hunt coons with traps and dogs yet I don't kill them. I let my dogs tree them and I go on to another track with my dog . I had hunted this bottom a night before and my dog was hot on a track deep in the woods bawlen the whole track when he shut up and not a sound from him for twenty minutes. Then all the sudden he came up the creek with his tail between his legs looking back and came straight to me. Ok first this is a hound who has never ran anything but coons and has never stopped tracking with out treeing, anyway, so I thought maybe he got spooked by a bobcat or something so I loaded him up and went home not thinking anything about it. The next evening on the 12th I pulled into the same open field in a bottom where two creeks join. I shined my lights of my truck along the trees of the creeks to see if I could spot some coon and low and behold I saw what I believe was a bigfoot in my head lights at about 75 yards was a enormous blackish brown figure was walking toward the trees through the field to the creek it stopped for a brief moment and just stared at me like it was looking right at me and took large lengthy steps into the woods. I was startled and not only was I startled but my hound in my back seat was startled as well whining and whimpering. I know what me and my hound saw and my dog hasn't ever backed down from an animal as long as I've had it and I've spent countless of hours in the timber with him.

Tonight when I got there, there was tracks crossing the road from the north to the south and they were wet and large foot prints. Its 18 degrees here, clearly not a humans tracks. There were 5 prints, one in front of the other, which was rather weird and I do have the pictures of them but their really hard to make out . It was awesome, I got some wood knock responses that were really close across the highway from me, the directions the prints were. I  shined the area and yet I never seen anything. I know what I heard. I'm going to keep squatching the area and a few others to hopefully get a picture of the squatch I saw on the 12th. I consider myself a very very good hunter and I am going to put some of my game cams in the area as well as camo up and sit in the area.

I decided to take some pictures. I crossed the dam over to the south side of the lake where I encountered two men fishing. I spoke briefly to one of the fisherman about the fish he\\u2019d caught that afternoon and the weather which was rather threatening. I wished him luck and headed west along the tree line when I encountered the other man. I spoke, but he seemed preoccupied so I walked on. I turned toward the tree line and started taking pictures into the woods after about the fourth picture I heard what I can only describe as a kind of a grunting snorting sound followed by a low but deep growl it was unlike anything I\\u2019d ever heard before. It sounded so close, but I didn\\u2019t see anything in the woods. I was petrified I turned and headed back towards the two men. I asked them if they\\u2019d heard anything one of the men was a little hesitant and really didn\\u2019t answer me the other man said yes it was probably a cougar. I told them to be careful and left just before I crossed the dam I stopped to take a picture of a large footprint in the mud. Already shaken by the experience and definitely inexperienced I failed to lie something down beside the footprint to gauge the size of it. But to be honest the only thing I wanted to do was put as much distance between me and those woods as possible. I crossed the dam to my car it was then I heard the same sound coming from across the lake in the vicinity of where I had been. It was muffled because of the distance, but still surprisingly loud that same grunting snorting growl.  The fisherman must have heard it as well because they were coming across the dam at a fairly fast pace.

As we traveled down E RD Mize Road towards the parking lot area, we were startled when a large creature on all fours crossed the road less than a hundred feet in front of us.

The back was arched and its head was tucked. I didn\\u2019t see a tail of any kind. I did however, notice the hair on its back was considerably shorter than it was on the rest of its body.

He ran out into the middle of the field and stood there looking at the direction he came from for about 15 min, Then ran off. 10 or 15 mins later I then heard this large something coming through the woods. Small trees breaking and leaves crunching. I had no idea what it was, I had my back against the wide tree 16' in the air, (the tree is wider than my back) and you cant see me or my stand from behind. It stopped right behind me, it is now dark, I could hear it breathing, it was 8 yards behind me, I didn't move, it stood there for about 5 minutes then started sniffing the air like it was smelling for something, then it started to move slightly, it was dry out and leaves covered the ground so you can hear anything move. Then 2 loud tree knocks, I then started to get a chill down my back, as I reached for my bow I heard 2 screams, I had my bow in hand and my shooting trigger was on my bow string and I WAS AT FULL BRAW. The screams vibrated the woods. It stood there pacing behind my tree, left to right then stopped to smell the air again, it started to move West at a regular walk/pace. I let off my bow, reached around the tree, clicked on my head lamp and about 12 yards from me was a 8' tall 700/800lb tall black figure, it grunted when my light came on and ran along the river bank and back into the woods. I did not see a face, I saw the back of IT. I will say this, It was hunting that night, it was smelling for scent and chasing deer, looking for food. At the time my bow was loaded with a 1.5\\\" expandable broad/arrow head, Yes I was at full draw not knowing what was going on, when my light was on and I drew my bow back again I was ready to shoot if it came back across the stream.

I am not saying for sure it was a bigfoot, but after reading the article you posted about   the young bigfoot caught on a game cam that some people say was \\\"just a bear\\\" made me realize that what I saw may have been a young bigfoot. My sighting was actually \\\"the near miss with a car\\\" experience. I am honestly not positive of the year, but it was near 1991 or 92. I was driving home from work, alone, about 1am. I had just turned onto the road I lived off of and was going down the first hill. Half way down, something ran across the road in front of me. I hit my brakes, natural instinct, barely missing it I was sure, and then I kept going.  It was merely seconds, but I knew what I saw was not something normal. It was on all fours, but the body and head seemed parallel to the ground, unlike the bears I have seen in zoos. (They seem to have a downward slope from their hip to their head.) The body was not large at the back half but evenly proportioned. The legs seemed to be easily defined. Not real thick at the top tapering down. The only way I can describe it would be that the legs came from the hip, no flap of skin coming from the belly region to the leg to make them look bigger at the body and it seemed the bending when it ran came from the hip and knee area. The thing that has bothered me all these years, the one thing I knew that separates this from your typical animal was the head. It was the way it looked in my direction as it ran. 1) In my experience, most animals running across the road like that don't even look at you.  2) What has bothered me the most, and I couldn't put my finger on til recently, was when it looked in my direction, it didn't turn it's head \\\"normally\\\". It brought it's head up a little, but it turned it sideways to see! (picture yourself on all fours, looking at the floor. Without lifting your head, look to the left. That is how it looked my way.) I did see two eyes and a mouth, it happened too quick to get a detailed look , but I saw a face, a face that did NOT have an extended snout. Lighter colored than the rest of the brown colored body. It seemed hairless, but again, I can't be positive how hairless it was. I had a radio on, so if there was anything to hear, I didn't hear it. The next day I drove past where I saw it and saw no signs of anything. Not then , or since then. I am from Muscatine, Iowa originally. We lived not too far from the river, right beside the levee actually, and back in the seventies there seemed to be a migratory path going thru the area. I recall hearing about an encounter with a neighbors dog, and going fishing at night only to be loaded very quickly back up into the truck by dad to leave the area because of large branches breaking in the woods. But in all the stories I have heard, I never realized that a young bigfoot is known to run on all fours so I never made the connection until I read your website.

The first was of screams in Arizona where I am living now. This one took place in Jackson County Mississippi in 1973. My father was living in Ocean Springs and working for Littons Ship Systems in Pascagoula. I had joined him there from Arizona when I decided to try my hand at pipefitting instead of Mining. I had bought an acre of land and put a trailer house on it before I had my wife join me. We were on the south side of town in an area of bayous. One night we were at my Dads place playing dominoes when we ran out of diapers for my baby daughter. It was only about a half mile from Dads to my house, so the wife and I jumped in the pick-up and went to the house for more diapers. I had two Red Bone hounds penned in the back of the house and when we got there they were barking as if they had something treed. I was curious as to what they were barking at, as they seldom barked while penned. When I got out of the truck, I noticed a rancid smell coming from the back of the house. I ask my wife what she had given the hounds and she said nothing that smelled that bad. I left the truck running and we went into the house and gathered the new diapers then back to the truck and left. We didn't give it anymore thought that night. I didn't pay much attention when we got back home later, but didn't remember smelling anything then. The next night we were back at my Dads playing dominoes again, and listening to the news from the TV. We heard a report from Pas Christian that a woman had called the police and reported a hairy ape looking man outside her backyard, looking in her kitchen window. She said it was looking over her back fence, which was six foot tall, and she could see it's head and shoulders above the fence. Also, the kicker was that it was accompanied by a rancid smell like rotting meat. The same smell I encountered around my house the night before. Wow, was that weird. I looked around the next morning, but couldn't find any tracks or anything around the house. And there was no smell of rotting meat to be detected.

After spending the night in my Grandfathers cabin up Alder Gulch, we geared up for an early morning hunt. My cousin and I rode in the back of my uncles pick-up truck with my dad riding shotgun. We planned on hunting the ridge to the west of my Grandfathers cabin. We had to drive about 2 miles south or as I would call it (up) Alder gulch to get to the road that goes to the ridge. We missed the turn to the ridge road, but quickly realized our error. Upon finding the correct road we progressed up the gradual slope climbing and meandering through mostly pine and some meadows dominated by waist-high sage brush. Of course, being opening deer season my cousin and I were being vigilant scanning every opening and meadow. My cousin and I were hanging on to the cab of my uncle's truck due to a slight uphill grade. To our right was an open hillside meadow covered with thigh high sage brush surrounded by pine trees. We both were scanning the meadow when my cousin said, \\\"there's another hunter, (slight pause) why is he wearing all black?\\\" All I could do was stare and keep staring. My cousin looked over at me because I had not said anything. We both viewed the animal for about 10 seconds. About 250 yards out in the sage brush meadow was a bigfoot. We banged on the cab so my uncle would stop. The pick-up came to a quick stop and as luck would have it, there were pine trees blocking our view from the sage brush meadow. We immediately said to back-up. As we backed up my cousin and I expected to see the bigfoot still in the meadow but there was no sight of him/her.  We both looked at each other in disbelief and questioned each other as to what we saw. Make no bones about it the animal had the distinctive dome shaped head with no neck broad shoulders and solid black. The animal was facing us and slightly bent forward and looked as if it was resting it's right arm on it's right knee. It occurred to me that he/she knew it got caught out in the open and was just going to stay motionless and hoped we would drive right by. The closest tree line was about 50 yards away from the big foot and it had taken us only about 15 seconds to get back to were we could see the sage brush meadow again. We didn't see the big foot again.  We didn't tell our dads until later on and just kept it to ourselves. My cousin and I continued to hunt deer that morning with a constant thought in the back of our minds of what we saw earlier. We did separate from each other as we hunted the ridge and I did get an eerie feeling that I was being watched. Hustling to find my cousin down the ridge and put the feeling of being watched behind me I heard a gun shot. My cousin did get a nice mule deer buck. This was about 2 to 2 1/2 miles from our sighting. I have hunted most of my life and have seen most animals that live in these woods. My cousin has been hunting all his life and knows every animal there is in these woods as well. We will never forget that morning and talk about it with each other occasionally.

The creek bottom is heavily forested,and a dense crop of a bamboo like reeds grow along the bottom. I was leaving the woods,but stalking slowly along a logging road. As I started up a hill,a doe deer that was bedded down just above the reed cane (on the side of the hill),jumped up and headed for the thick cover of the reeds. The deer was angling to my right,and down into the reeds. I quickly got to higher ground,above the reeds,in hopes of seeing the deer as she slipped through the reeds. As I was watching her white tail waving through the thick,green and brown cover,something to my extreme right moved,and on the other side of the creek. I could not really understand what I was seeing. I saw a tall,(in comparison to the reeds,which grow at least 4-6 ft tall)figure moving away from me,and it appeared to be dark,and sort of mottled in color. The mottling was not in highly contrasted colors,but simply darker shades of brown,and slightly lighter shades of brown.Maybe it was the effect of the sun filtering through the leaves. It was the early part of the deer season,and the leaves had not fallen entirely. I estimate the distance to maybe 50 yards. Being above the reeds,was the ONLY way I could have seen this. As I watched it move through the woods,it appeared to have what I would call a hump on it's back,and I only saw that when it turned and looked in my direction,as it pushed through the vegetation. I had the perception that it went through some very heavy limbs,as I saw them snap back once it was through. It did not seem to be running,but moving quickly,and with no need to duck or dodge the vegetation.It just pushed through it. I will admit,that I was unbelievably unsure of what I had seen.I was scared to be honest. At that time,and as it is now,black bears were NOT known to inhabit that part of our state. And,black bears do not walk very far in an upright manner.This was upright. I did not go back into that bottom again. I hunted a very large clearcut area that afternoon,and I could see for several hundred yards in each direction. I was armed with a heavy caliber hunting rifle,and armed with a .44 mag. revolver,and I would not venture back in there again I have seen no tracks on the creek bottoms,or around muddy spots,that we could not identify.

At midnight, we were preparing to retire for the night to our respective tents, when we heard a prolonged howl which was about as far away from us as the 1994 Columbiana, OH, howl (on the BFRO website) seemed from its source.  At least, that's the best way I could determine the distance from us.  This howl was at least twice as long (I want to say even longer) as the Columbiana, OH, howl.  I'd estimate the howl we heard to be more or less ten seconds long. It was the length of the call, as much as it was the deep tone and strength of it, which attracted our immediate attention.  It just didn't seem to quit.  It wasn't interrupted, either, like if the creature took a breath and then continued.  This went on continuously for around 10 seconds. Although we only heard the one howl, it was so loud (for its distance from us) and so prolonged, and gained strength at the end instead of waning, that we were rather shaken by its magnitude .... commenting to each other that nothing human or zoological that we knew of, could possibly have made that noise. I have studied/researched Sasquatches since grad school in Idaho in the mid-1970's, even though my degree is in Literature/English.  I roamed the Rockies of the NW every chance I got for most of five years, looking for evidence, tracks, sign, sounds, anything......found zilch.  This is the first experience I have had, and even though auditory, it was exhilirating.  Both my friend and I were struck by the animal-like characteristics of this howl, and tried to think of things which might have made the sound, OTHER than a sasquatch.  No, we decided quite without hesitation, it couldn't have been a machine-made sound (like a siren) because it was too low in tone.  No, we decided, it couldn't have been fireworks, as they tend to \\\"scream\\\" and then wane, whereas this howl was low in tone and went on for a number of seconds (beyond 5 or 6 secs.) and gained momentum and strength toward the end, so we ruled fireworks out.  Since it was July 4th weekend, that's why this was a consideration.  No human could make that loud a howl for that period of time.... human lung capacity way too small, we concluded. And, on we went, trying to explain to each other the howl/sound by some origin other than a sasquatch.  He and I had been joking and talking for the past several years about perhaps encountering one, hearing one, etc., but never really expected this to happen.  When it did, we wanted to try to cover all the potentialities for the source of such a sound, and a sasquatch is all we could come up with, esp. Since I had heard the Columbiana Ohio sound on your website, and was immediately reminded of it when hearing (and replaying in my head) that sound on 7/2/05.

There aren't many houses on this mountain due to the fact that it runs with the Pisgah National Forest. I went in the house to get the cd player.  It was a very still night.  We listened to a few songs; when we decided to play the Sierra Sounds cd with bigfoot recordings on it.  As we listened to the cd we all became jumpy and the feeling of someone was watching us came over us.  We then started hearing sounds of what sounded like saplings being broken up above us; higher up in the mountain.  We just laughed it all off as nerves.  Then we heard what sounded like a tree about ten inches around being broke then slide down the mountain at us.  All us became scared and ran to the porch of the house for protection.

I was at the trailhead of Dutchmans Creek at 9 in the morning during a week day about two weeks ago. Mine was the only car at the trailhead until after 10:30 with only logging trucks passing through every 30-45 minutes. I was walking down Dutchmans Creek, enjoying the solitude and quiet of the forest when I turned a bend and heard a loud wood knock at my two o'clock and was answered by another at my 10  o'clock within one second of the first. It threw me off because it sounded like an answering reply. I walked back up the trail and hung out for about thirty minutes just listening relaxing before I choose to head back down the trail. As i approached the same bend in the trail I again heard a wood knock at my 10 o'clock and then a second at my 5 o'clock. Extremely weird I thought, and again within one second of each other. I decided to walk back up the trail towards the second knock. There's an atv trail near the trailhead I walked up until I heard another wood knock around the same area I would have estimated the second at my 5 o'clock would have been. I waited for about fifteen minutes without hearing or seeing anything else. I decided to walk back to the base of the trail head and within twenty foot steps back down the trail I heard something huff at me from over my left shoulder. It came from inside a deep ditch but I didn't see anything there. I've had deer huff at me before when I've gotten close and they spotted me, I'm sure bear huff as well to threaten/challenge something but what got me was that I heard and saw no movement at all throughout this entire time. I walked back to the trailhead, waited 15-20 min and then snook back towards the same spot. I was completely quiet; no rustling from my clothes, boots didn't rustle plants and no crunch from dried leaves or twigs. As I approached I heard what sounded like a guttural baby moan or call. This occurred in high brush on the other side of the ditch to my right. The sound occurred every hand full of minutes and I would creep closer to see if I could spot it. Though the sound would change the direction it was facing there was never any movement in the brush and though I always carry when I'm in the woods I dared not enter into the thick brush, especially since I couldn't identify the animal that had huffed at me nor what type of animal was making the cries from in the brush. I didn't feel spooked until after the event when I thought over what had happened.

I go backpacking and backcountry camping year round. I am not an expert but I have experience in the woods. My wife, two dogs, and I were camping in Uwharrie National on October 23 -25. Friday night we heard a lot of noises ranging from coyotes far away to leaves rustling just outside our site. I just purchased a hammock and wanted to try it out in the woods. So Saturday I set up my hammock 20-30 feet into the woods just outside our site. Our site is on the side and near the entrance of the campground and the most secluded with the woods to its back; this is why we choose it. So I go to bed in the hammock Saturday night facing the campground and the woods behind me, and all is well until 2:30am, I wake up to branches breaking behind my head. The branches sounded like they could have been as close as 30 feet to as far away as 50 feet to my right. Imagine if my head is 12 o\\u2019clock and my feet are 6 o\\u2019clock, these branches were being broken at 11-12 o\\u2019clock or over my right shoulder. At first I thought it was a deer or a bear passing by but I know what they sound like as they walk (a couple months ago I was face to face with a mother bear and her cubs), but I never actually heard distinct footsteps and as the breaking didn\\u2019t move in location I became a little freaked out. I\\u2019m lying in the hammock trying to explain what is going on and nothing is making sense. I never made a noise to scare it away and didn\\u2019t shine my headlamp. Then I hear a noise that is hard to explain come from about 1 o\\u2019clock or over my left shoulder. I can only describe this as similar to the noise a deer makes when it\\u2019s alerting other deer to danger, but if a deer were to make this noise it would have to be 20 feet tall. It was deeper than any noise I\\u2019ve ever heard come from the forest. Deeper than a lion\\u2019s roar and as long as a human\\u2019s sigh. The branch breaking continued for about 15 minutes until I start hearing the alternating branch break and what sounded like a large bird flapping its wings one time. I heard \\u2018snap whoosh, snap whoosh, snap whoosh\\u2019. About this time, I hear my wife coughing and before we went to bed she said that her stomach was feeling a little upset, I thought maybe she is sick. I muster up the courage to get out of the hammock hoping that in doing so I will also scare away the animal. I go up to her and she\\u2019s fine, now I have a dilemma, I don\\u2019t want to go back but I can\\u2019t stay in the tent because my sleeping bag is in the woods. So I go back and I pick up a branch, snap it and throw it in to the woods three times. Then I urinate all around my hammock. While I was doing this the branch breaking had ceased. I get in the hammock and seconds after turning off my headlamp the breaking begins again. I listen, while getting more and more scared, to the breaking for a couple more minutes. I shine my light into the woods and the breaking stops, I turn off the light and it starts back. I waited a couple more minutes and turned my light on again and the breaking stops, I turn the light off and it starts back. I\\u2019m lying in the hammock completely terrified at this point and decide the only thing I should do is retreat to the tent with my wife and dogs. It was like torture to be in the hammock. So I quickly grab my sleeping bag, walk to the tent, get in, and lay down. We both heard the branches being broken for about 15 more minutes, then we heard one large break that sounded like a 4 inch log being broken in half that echoed through the woods. It was almost as if they were saying \\u2018And stay out\\u2019. I was so terrified and my adrenaline was pumping so much that I couldn\\u2019t sleep for about an hour. The next day my wife and I look around the area for any sign of foot print or the branches themselves. I didn\\u2019t find any sign of activity. We did find a grassy area with three large rock piles. Two of the piles were old and had trees growing out of the pile, one was newer with nothing but small vegetation growing on top. One thing to keep in mind is that the area is frequented by campers so there are few branches, especially large ones, on the ground for anything to step on; and there are paths all through the area and as we all know animals will always take the easiest route when traveling. Something else we thought of is Saturday we both went to the bathroom deep in the woods, we thought \\\"what if we encroached in their land?\\\".

The house my mother lived in when she was 10 is less than a quarter mile away from the house that she lives in today. All of the yards in that neighborhood sort of connect with somewhat of a gully in the middle. The first time my mother had any knowledge of the thing, her sister and her were swinging on a double tire swing in her backyard. The next thing my mother knew, her sister had jumped off the swing and was running and screaming. My mom didn't know what to do, so she ran after her sister into the house. Her sister was hysterical saying she saw something in the back wooded area of their yard. I guess my grandpa did find some sort of large footprints. This was the first incident. The next incident was when my mom was outside her house when she was young. She saw a large thing covered in hair walking across her driveway. My mom told me that the \\\"thing\\\" walked almost as if it was bo-legged. She also said it's shoulders moved from side to side as it walked. Now my mother lives in the house I grew up in. As recently as two weeks ago, something has been seen in my mother's back yard. It hasn't only been seen by my mother, but also by my sister who frequently stays at my mom's house. About three years ago (April of 2002) is when my mom had her most vivid and frightening encounter with the \\\"thing\\\". She was letting our dogs out in the backyard and they both went barreling towards the fence surrounding our yard barking. My mom walked out in the yard, thinking nothing other than the dogs were just being dogs, and was standing waiting for them to use the bathroom. It was then when she noticed something moving in the next yard. She said it was about seven feet tall and standing behind a tree. She said as fast as the dogs had ran up to the fence to bark, they were running back to the house yelping. My mom said she froze. She always tells me the fear that she feels when she sees this \\\"thing\\\" is overwhelming. She said it then \\\"leaped\\\" from behind one tree to another. That's when she started running. She said she looked behind her and it was now coming forward towards her. She ran in the house and locked the doors. My mom lives in a brick house and she has also told me that on occasion she will hear something that sounds like something beating or throwing itself up against the side of her house. My mom is completely afraid of this \\\"thing\\\". We would really like someone to contact us or something. My mom doesn't really talk about this to anyone because she feels that they'd all think she was crazy.

It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees. As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \\\"its nothing\\\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something. I said to myself \\\"its time to go!\\\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals. From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it's nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don't think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn't know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother's yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what's wrong ?

All of a sudden, my brother grabbed my hand (because he saw the creature) and said lets get out of here. As we proceeded back towards our house, I turned around and I could see six to seven foot tall upright walking animal covered with very thick hair approaching us at a very rapid pace. I noticed its shoulders were extremely wide and when it walked, it made strides that were very non human like in proportion. We ran back to our house and it followed us never catching up to us. When we made it back to our driveway, a car was coming in the other direction. Then, my brother and I turned around to catch another look at the creature as it was running into the weeds on north side of the road.

We arrived at the pull off about noon and proceeded to hike the 2 miles to where Crystal lake was located. When we arrived at the lake we set up a small fire and our sleeping bags on a small knoll overlooking the lake and then went down the hill to an old road and walked about a mile or so when my friend Darren found a large footprint in the clay-like mud off the side of the road, we all were amazed at how big this print was, I wear a size 12 boot and it was at least 4 inches longer than my boot. It was a very fresh track, so fresh Icould make out the loops and swirls on the pads of the toes and part of the sole. We got really nervous and a little scared because we all had a lot of experience in the woods hiking and hunting and none of us had ever believed or seen anything about Bigfoot, but We changed our minds very quickly after seeing that print. We made our way back to the camp and sat around the fire and just kind of took it all in and discussed what we had found and tried to dismiss it and go on with our trip. Later on in the evening we heard nromal woodland creatures and birds but it got very quiet and nothing made a sound for hours. We were getting scared and wondered if we should leave but curiosity got the best of us and we decided to stay the rest of the night. We ate dinner about 7p.m. and sat around the fire and talked until at exactly 11:23 p.m.(I will remember the exact time as long as I live)we heard what can be described as a cross between a bark and a scream came from below our camp near the lake shore, it was the most unnerving thing I have ever heard we all just sat and stared at each other unable to talk or move. This went on for about 5 minutes until about a half mile away we heard another answer the first with a series of high pitched barks and screams. That is when we decided it was time to go home, but we were afraid to leave the same way we had come because we would have had to walk past the area where we had heard the scream at first. We decided to walk up another level and skirt the cliffs around the back of the lake but when we make up to the steppe above us we ran right into whatever it was making the sound, I was in front and had a Maglite, the beam hit the midsection of the creature and I stopped dead in my tracks. I observed a seven to eight foot tall creature standing not more than 10 feet away from me as I shined the light up I seen red eyes. I have hunted all sorts of animals and I have never seen one with red eyes that seemed to glow in the light. I back stepped and almost knock over everyone behind me and the creature ran up an embankment and we all ran back to the fire and sat back to back until we decided to go ahead and go back to the road and make our way to the car. We made it to the raod and started walking the 2 miles to the car all the while listening to the 2 creatures yelling and screaming one was behind us and the other was on our right flank pacing us from about 10 to 15 yards. Earlier in the day we had passed a huge pile of old tires someone had dumped, But when we got to that point of the road about 30 of the tires were thrown out into the road like someone or something didn't want us to leave. When we made it to the car we  all piled in and left as fast as the car would go.

The only reason why I'm taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about. My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970's. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \\\"Indian Cedar Swamp\\\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush. We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up. These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening. I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70's commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning). The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well. As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad. My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off. We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it's crystal clear. For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We've never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn't for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing. I'm now in my 30's an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn't see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I'll never know, Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I'm not a fan of ghosts, UFO's or even big foot. I'm not sure to this day what I saw wasn't a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn' good costume and a damn' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I'm sure my mother would.\", \"location_details\": \"In a development off RT 112 in Charlestown known as Five Seasons.\", \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Rhode Island\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 6643: Mother and son see sasquatch closeup from road\", \"latitude\": 41.432, \"longitude\": -71.65183, \"date\": \"1978-07-15\", \"number\": 6643.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"drm59w2wzk\", \"temperature_high\": 68.56, \"temperature_mid\": 65.805, \"temperature_low\": 63.05, \"dew_point\": 62.27, \"humidity\": 0.88, \"cloud_cover\": 0.8, \"moon_phase\": 0.33, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0285, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.7, \"summary\": \"Heavy rain in the morning and afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 5.71, \"wind_bearing\": 161.0, \"wind_speed\": 5.47, \"location\": \"POINT(-71.65183 41.431999999999995)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have recently become very interested in bigfoot research, and based on reports that I found on this website of previous incidents in the area, decided to go to Great Swamp in Rhode Island to look for any evidence of bigfoot.

We  whispered to each other and watched it while it watched us. We were 2 grown men paddling parallel to the shore and about 200 feet out but we could not summon up the courage to go in closer. This thing had a strange look, almost a crazed grin. Like a giant Lemur.  The sun was set now as we continued to watch it in the shadows of the mountain.

I was following up on a report submitted to this sight in Sabathday Pt. which occured about 3 to 4 years prior to my own investigation, anyhow , my search started in sabathday pt. I went to a local marina right by where the sounds were heard , asked a girl behind the counter if anything strange was seen or heard in the area. to my suprise she said UFO's were sighted in Ticonderoga, Ithen said what about bigfoot and she replied that there was a sighting only three weeks ago in Ticonderoga! I was amazed that i could be so close to an occurrence, she told me that it was sighted at a cemetary in Ticonderoga and that a local vetnarian she goes to was investigating, she gave me his name and directions to his place and to the cemetary, off I went. The Vet was in surgery and the nurse said she knew nothing of such a thing and that the Dr. had nothing to do with it, personally i just got the blow off,so i preceded to goto the cemetery.As I approached the cemetary there was a blueberry and rasberry farm right before it. Istopped there and asked a few questions to the girl behind the counter. She was very helpful and a big smile came over her face when i started talking about it . She had a friend who knew of some local kids who saw it one night, anyway i asked if i could walk around the fields to look for signs of bigfoot since it was a farm where you could go pick your own berries, there had been rain so any sings of tracks would have been washed away. I found nothing in the fields, so off to the cemetary i went. At the cemetary the ground was hard and any footprints would have been gone from the rains . Iwalked the whole cemetary on both sides of the street, along all of the edges and into the surounding forest about 10 to 25 feet in. Upon walking in the trees I came upon a sapling about 8 inches in diameter broken at the 6 foot level , it was about 4 feet into the woods from the edge of the grounds of the cemetary. I stand 5 feet 11 inches and it was broken just about an inch or two above my head. This was a definite sign, the tree was still fresh and the leaves were still green and the break was clean like a snapped pencil, although it was still attached to the lower trunk, in front of this tree was a huge oak about fifteento twenty feet and ti would have shielded this tree from a wind.So Ican say in my investigation that this was not from a windfall as there were other trees around it that were significantly smaller. I took two pictures and did not find anything else at the sight. Next to the cemetary was a house . Iproceeded to the door and rang the bell. A girl about 11 answered , I asked if her mom or dad were home and they weren't. Iasked if she had heard anything strange at night or if her dog went crazy at night or barked alot .

I stepped back a little and I saw aprox 60ft in front of me a figure comming up a slight incline in the terrain. My first thought was. \\\"Ok, bear in front of me run.\\\" as I went to run I noticed it had turned slightly and the one main characteristic I noticed was no snout like a bear would have. More like a human face although I couldnt see features. More of an outline. This really scared me. I ran to the tent and told my friends. They were sure it was a bear and we waited 10min before going back to the cabin. I later realized that this \\\"thing\\\" that I saw had a Human shape. I got a look at it for maybe 5 seconds. And like I said I am not much of an outdoorsman and probally wouldnt know a bear from an ape while in the woods....But what I saw was something unusual. It looked like a huge hairy man walking up a hill (fairly blunt but best way I could describe it). I was thinking it could be a bear on its hind legs, but It wasnt staggering. it was WALKING.

We were at the top of the Mtn when I had this eary feeling about the woods ahead. I have never felt like that before in the woods during daylight. We started to smell rain in the air and it was getting chilly quick. We were already 2 hours into our hike at least. Anyways, we stuck with our gut feeling and starting heading back. About ten minutes later, a big rock came flying from the left heading towards the right and hit another rock and made a loud crack. The rock must have rolled for at least 5 seconds afterwards. I could tell by the sound the rock made when it hit, that is was a big rock. And the fact that it rolled for such a long distance afterward. It had to be someone or something very strong. We stuck around the area for another 5-7 minutes to see if we could see or hear anything but no luck. I had already known that this area has had its own encounters with bigfoot so I suspected that this was what it was. I decided to start throwing rocks back into the woods in the direction of the 1st rock as we continued walking back. I continued this down the trail. I was hoping to get a rock in return, and before long, I did. Another rock came in our direction. They were not thrown directly at us but above us and behind us. We were in shock. I just couldn't believe that someone or something was throwing rocks back at me. I continued throwing rocks into the woods as I walked and the rocks were returned. I felt as if it were playful at first, but it then became aggressive. We came to a pond and the trail wrapped around part of the pond. We heard a tree moving but it sounded like it was being shaken. the wind was definitely not making the tree make that sound. Keep in mind that something has been rock throwing for at least 20 minutes now. We stopped in this area and was trying to see where the noise was coming from. I couldn't see a thing. I decide to take a step in the direction of the noise and I felt my stomach drop. I knew there was something there. I couldn't see it but I could feel it. It was one of those feelings you just have to have yourself to understand. I moved back onto the trail and I decided to pick up a few rocks and start throwing them in that direction to see if I could get a return rock. It didn't take long before one came flying back. I decided to be brave again and try to step off the trail and throw a few rocks closer towards where the rocks were being thrown at me. This time I had a rock the size of a baseball. As I was throwing my rock, a rock bigger than mine was also in the air coming towards me. It came extremly close to my head. My friend was on the trail behind me so she had a clear view of the rock coming towards me. The rock hit a tree behind me and bounced onto the trail. There was no denying that these were not rocks now! The proof was there. It seemed that whatever they were, they were getting annoyed with me. The rocks were now being thrown directly at me instead of around me. We decided to knock it off for a little while and get the heck out of there. about 5 minutes down the way, I suspected that we were being followed out of the woods. So to see if something was still there, I picked up some rocks again. I started throwing them one after another without stopping. I must have thown about 5 or 6 when a rock came soaring down from the high cliff at us. I said to my friend \\\"see I told you they were still here.\\\" I knew that whatever it was, was just as curious about me as I was of it. They continued to fire a few more rocks off the cliff at me; they were definitely trying to hit me! I looked so hard into the woods but I couldn't see a thing. I thought maybe it was just a person, but I don't believe that is was. Especially from the high cliff. A person would have been noticed easliy. The last but not least rock was the icing on the cake. I was not even expecting it. We were walking and talking for a few minutes and I was not throwing any rocks when a rock the size of a softball came down and wizzed past our heads. We both ducked and covered our heads out of instinct. If we did not duck, one of us would have been hit. That was it for me. I knew it was time to get out of those woods and stop messing around. It was an expierence we will never forget. I have no idea what is in those woods up there but that was the wierdest thing that has ever happened to me. We will chalk it up in our memory book.

This I gauged by seeing a fence line at that distance. At the time my tested vision was 20/10 (documented). We both watched as this man approached the fence line.  He cleared it without stopping.  Simply stepped over it as if it were a low stool.  Knowing that the snow was not that deep or that hard to support a man of his apparent size, and that it was highly unlikely for anyone to be out on the marshes at that time of night, I stepped out of the car to get a better look. As soon as I had gotten out of the car, the man changed course and began heading straight toward us.  I closed the car door to cancel the interior light, and prevent showing my location.  At this point the man broke into a run.  His speed was incredible.  He closed the distance between us very quickly.  My girlfriend was screaming for me to get back into the car at this point. I got back into the car, and she drove back over the bridge into NYS.  As we went, I looked behind us and saw that we were being pursued, although we were building a gap.  As soon as we returned to hardtop road, he broke off pusuit and ran back into the forest near the bridge. We returned to town and never spoke of this incident to anyone other than two trusted friends.  I have since told friends and relatives that I saw \\\"something\\\" out there but could not say that it was any animal I had ever seen, nor could it have been any man. I should add that at that time I had spent 16 years working and playing outdoors.  I had encountered all of the major predators of our area, knew their habits and habitats.

My family and I have owned property in the Dresden NY area (off of RT 22, a few miles north of Whitehall) since the early sixties through last year when I sold my property (located on Blue Goose Rd, old RT 22) last year.

It was a damp, still early November day, thinking back it may have been Election Day. The time was around 8AM as I hiked up the logging road. The smell drifted away as quickly as I smelled it but it was distinct. I've never smelled anything like it since and I have been with hunters that took Adirondack bears and this odor was different. It actually raised the hairs on the back of my neck, it was definitely a strange odor. The tracks were sort of footlike but very wide. The toe area was mushed in the mud so it was difficult to determine if there were claws like a bear or any other type of distinguishing features. In retrospect, I should have reported this immediately but the only person I told was my wife and a few hunting buddies. No one completely dismissed my story but it was like, oh, thats something but I know what I smelled and sensed and it definitely gave me the creeps. I am interested in your organization and I'd be willing to go back to the area with someone involved with BFRO and take you to the site. Please contact me at T********@nycap.rr.com to  discuss.

The impetus for this investigation stems from my own sighting in the area in the 1980's and the anecdotal reports on BFRO concerning the behaviors of the species. The family property is situated in the Town of Whitehall in Washington County New York.  We used to operate a tree farm on the property and were there quite often, even staying overnight, on weekends and weekdays. --------------------------- [Click the image above for larger version of this map.] ---------------------------- Frequently I would hear repetitious 'knocking' always coming from the west, southwest, or northwest of us.  When I was younger I thought nothing of it.  As I got older and realized it was coming from our own property, I began to ask those with me what I was hearing.  No one could say anything except, \\\"Some one with an axe I guess\\\". I spent much more time in the forest than anyone I knew.  Soon, the idea that some lazy axe man was there every time I was in the forest occurred as too large a coincidence.  I went looking for the trespasser, but never could catch up to him, or find what he was chopping at a rate of four to five blows every ten to fifteen minutes. On the return visit I wasn't disappointed.  There is a particular place formely part of the property which the species may frequent for some reason.  I headed there in a deliberate attempt to provoke a reaction. The knocking began as soon as I was 1/4 mile into the forest. I was moving uphill, and off trail so I was making a good amount of noise as I went. At first it was one source to my front (west) which, as always, retreated in front of me.  As I came closer to my destination, the knocking began to circle around me.  At this point there were as many as three sources of knocking and it was coming at regular intervals. As I crested the ridge and began the final approach to the destination, the range and the intervals of the knocking decreased.  This remained steady until I reached the destination at which point I turned and headed northward to an old farm road and homestead site (occupied).  At this point the knocking trailed off, the range and interval decreased and eventually it ended altogether. From here I climbed east over the mountain again to return to my place of origin.  There was no further incident of knocking during the return trip. On the second day (8th), I returned to a site we used to frequent during our tree farming days.  This was a site we used frequently for our overnight stays.  While approaching this site from the east and travelling uphill, the knocking began immediately.  Again the knocking stayed to my front (west) until I reached my destination.  Once there, the knocking stopped all together.  I occupied the site for a few hours.  During this time I ate lunch, and, being an ecologist, I collected samples of vegetation and made notes and sketches of the changes occuring in the surrounding forest. While walking the perimeter of the clearing in which this site is located, I heard a sound which is best described as a 'buck snort' played poorly on a low-quality decoy.  A 'snort' is the noise a buck makes when he's expressing aggression or agitation.  It came from the vicinity of a rock outcropping approximately 25-yards to my north-northwest.  Thinking about it now, it was almost comical.  At the time however, I was more than a little frightened by it. I turned, walked quickly to my pack, and removed a survival rifle.  As I assembled the rifle, several stones flew over my head, but near enough for me to hear them going past.  As soon as the rifle was assembled and brought to bear, the rocks stopped flying and the forest was quiet.  I left the area after that with the rifle at the ready.  There were no further incidents. This was a scouting trip intended to assess the area for activity and the potential for a sighting.  I plan to return to this area with others (wildlife biologists) for further study and observation.\", \"location_details\": \"[Private property on a mountain near Whitehall.

The object we saw was located at approximately 43 degrees 35.086 minutes north and 073 degrees 34.347 minutes west per a Google Earth view obtained on 5-5-2015.  We were about 140 yards away (even though it didn't seem that far) and the bearing from us to it was about 132 degrees true, again using Google Earth to obtain distance and bearing.  This section of the lake is state property and part of the \\\"Forever Wild\\\" section of the Adirondacks.  There are many square miles of wilderness here and this location is only about 8 miles from the locally famous Whitehall, NY sightings in 1976. We were motoring in our 19' I/O boat northeastish in a narrow channel between Sarah Island, Hazel Island, an un-named rocky outcrop and the mainland.  Our intended goal was Fox Island, a short distance away.  We were traveling about 5 mph, slightly above idling speed, engine rpm would be approximately 1000.  There is a point of land opposite the rocky outcrop and as we cleared it, a small bay exists on our starboard (right) side.  Since I'm always scanning the lake side to side for boat traffic, at that point in time, I was looking to the east into the bay and I noticed movement close to the shoreline.  It seemed that whatever it was, was caught by surprise as we cleared that point of land.  I then got my wife's attention, she looked in that direction and also saw it. My view was of a very large black animate object that seemed to quickly raise an arm (?) from it's side to a horizontal position then turn away and move back and to the side (north) behind a nearby clump of coniferous trees.  I then spun the boat around for a better view.  Meanwhile, my wife (Debbie) was watching it.  Her impression was that it was large, dark, upright and didn't move like an animal.  Her view was slightly restricted by the trees but she did notice that the object was swaying from side to side.  The only (known) animal that is large and black out here in the Adirondacks is the black bear and we both strongly believe it wasn't a bear (I've seen many bears in the woods).  It was an observation of very short duration but long enough to impress us.  Unfortunately we can't provide any accurate dimensions or descriptions of physical details but even though we're not sure of what is was, we're sure of what it was not! We then continued on to Fox Island which is about 200 yards from the sighted critter and only about 50 feet from the mainland and chatted for a bit.  Eventually we got the charcoal grill fired up and proceeded to cook a traditional meal of dogs and beans, of course with the appropriate condiments.  We do this on a regular basis on the islands of the lake.  As we were eating, we both had a weird feeling so we QUICKLY finished our meal, loaded the gear back on the boat and left or as some may say, got the heck out of Dodge.  We've never had that type of experience on the lake before and are not sure if the two events are related.  I've recently become aware that some folks have a theory about how our favorite mystery creature may use/communicate with infrasound which could explain that feeling we both had. We returned to the area on July 6, 2015 by boat with my brother who is an accomplished photographer to investigate the mainland.  By then, the NYDEC had installed docks in that bay so we could tie up to and go ashore.  We went to the area where the critter was first observed and noted that there was a small, probably seasonal stream that flowed into the lake.  We searched for but did not find any tracks or other sign.  However I recently purchased a trail cam and plan to set it up in that area.  Preliminary testing has shown that the motion sensor is very sensitive and wind generated tree movement will trigger it.  I've got a few ideas on how to mount it but am still trying to come up with the appropriate \\\"bait\\\".   Got any ideas? Also this spring (2016), I shared our occurrence with BF researcher Bill Brann who runs the Northern Sasquatch Research Society who was present during a public screening of a documentary called Beast of Whitehall, The Abair Road Incident that was made by the Ohio firm, Small Town Monsters.  He then mentioned that he had a report of an anchored boat by Fox Island that had rocks thrown at it at night.  It was probably the same bay which is quite protected from boat traffic. Again, we both have had over 40 years of outdoors experience and are very familiar with Adirondack wildlife.

Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Ohio\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 3180: Early evening sighting by two children, near Layman\", \"latitude\": 39.40877, \"longitude\": -81.73172, \"date\": \"1978-07-04\", \"number\": 3180.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dpjbhnhu8z\", \"temperature_high\": 77.04, \"temperature_mid\": 71.555, \"temperature_low\": 66.07, \"dew_point\": 62.68, \"humidity\": 0.76, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.97, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.07, \"summary\": \"Foggy in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 5.0, \"visibility\": 3.92, \"wind_bearing\": 350.0, \"wind_speed\": 5.64, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.73172 39.408770000000004)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I would like to share with you what I saw as a boy.

We watched the fireworks, then I offered to drive her home. I don't know the township road, but it is off state Route 676. We parked for a while then drove on to where she was staying. On the way to the house she had fallen asleep with her head in my lap, so she didn't see a thing. As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet. On both sides of the road were fence and cornfields. Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line. I was stunned and didn't say a word and just kept driving along slowly looking at this thing. As I went by it just looked at me. I didn't have a clue what to do, so I kept going.

We heard them scream and we stood up and were kinda worried because we were on the opposite side of the house than them. So we got up to make sure they were all right, but they came around the house before we could get to far. They went on to tell us that they heard something really big running in the thick patch of woods. My brother was going into the thicket to hide. When he started in that's when he heard something take off running. The sun was about to disappear as night grew nearer and he was still spooked from the noise he heard and refused to go hide anymore. I just thought that it was probably a deer since our area is very populated with them. So we got off the porch and was walking around the corner of the house when I looked up towards the road. Now to give you a brief description of the terrain. From where the thicket ends there is about 20 yards of short mowed grass which meets up with State Route 550 then on the other side of the road it slopes down fairly sharp and then into a cornfield. As it was striding across the road is where I saw it. It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms. The body was very thick, thicker than any human body I've ever seen. The head looked like it ended in a point rather than a rounded head like a humans. It seemed to run in slow motion as I stood there in amazement. It went over the bank when it got to the other side of the road. We jumped up onto the porch and went inside to tell my dad.

Ii grew up in germantown. from the time I was young I remember hearing people tell stories of bigfoot, occult activity, and all other kinds of nonsense stories. When I was younger I would go coon hunting with my uncle and 2 cousins every now and then, so I know animal sounds and as long as I'm with others who know the woods too, I dont really spook easy. The first incident that happened to me was when i was about 15 years old. I lived down a gravel lane off of state route 4 heading from dayton to middletown. There were 3 houses at the end of the lane. They were staggered one, then another across the lane and down a bit, then the 3rd house back on the original side and down a little further still. I lived in the last house at the deadend of the lane. My friend at the time lived across the lane, diagonally from me. The distance between his front porch to mine was about 40-50 yards away. One night kinda late, I was leaving his house. I started off his porch across the gravel lane. I had just reached the very front of my yard when i heard some twigs snapping, and a bit of rustling behind me coming from the thickets that were beside of his house next to where they had a dog kennel. The dogs however, were in the house at the time. the thickets consisted of grown up bushes and a couple pine trees. Just after that line of brush was a fence seperating land from another house down a ravine that had a different access road than our lane. Just after that fence was a drop off of about 2 feet. So the fence itself was about 5 feet tall if you were coming over it from the other side. When I heard the rustling behind me I stopped and stood completely still and started to listen real hard.  It was dead quiet, I mean NO sound at all coming from anywhere. I had that uneasy feeling that you get when you know something just isnt right, \\\"you all know what im talking about\\\". I kinda turned my head but not so much to look as more to try and listen better. I kinda didnt want to turn around to look because I was so scared. mind you that there is a city-type streetlight post right beside the lane about middle ways between my house and my buddies house, so it wasnt really dark necessarily. It was pretty well lit. Just like any other streetlight you would be right next to.  After listening for about half a minute i turned to walk home. As soon as I turned i heard the sounds again. almost as if it was watching me turn to leave again. I took off like a shot. My hearing was so in tune to what was going on around me, even though I was running faster that i ever had before. I could hear my feet kicking up behind me, and behind that I could hear the sounds of twigs snapping turning into the sounds of limps cracking. Whatever it was behind me, was BIG, and it sounded like it was chasing me. To my own amazement I ran a little faster when I heard that. It was kinda weird, as i was running, scared as could be, I was trying to reason with myself saying in my mind that it was probably just a deer, and that I was being foolish. But I wasnt going to chance it. Just as I finished the thought of my stupid self running so fast from a deer. I heard a screaching sound that i have never heard any animal make before. It was kind of like a cross between a howler monkey, a screech owl, and a peacock. Those of you that have heard a peacock would probably agree that if you didnt know it was a peacock it would spook you. When I got to my front door I grabbed it and threw it open and started to run in. As I was turning to close the door as fast as I could, I looked to see how close it might be to me. Just on the outer ring of the light from the streetlight I could see that something was pushing the  pine trees over a bit. And I could see something come from over the fence from the other side. I have absolutely NO DOUBT that what I saw was a bigfoot. The ambient lighting made that clear to me. I was screaming and crying hysterically as I ran in the front door, then slammed it shut, then locked all 3 locks. 2 deadbolts and the knob lock. I lived with my mom at the time but she was on vacation. My cousin who is a pretty big guy, and who has been in a lot  of streetfights was staying there to keep an eye on me while my mom was gone. He was sleeping when I came in the house. He heard me screaming and jumped up to see what was wrong. He grabbed my moms gun which was a .38 special 3 inch barrel chiefs special. and came out to the living room to see what I was freaking out about. Later he said that all I kept saying was that it was going to get me over and over, and that he could see how scared I was and thought that someone had broken into the house and was still in there. He tried to calm me down and asked me what was wrong. I pointed at the front door and said one word.... outside. He went to open the door, and I told him not to. He's the kind of guy who isnt afraid of a human. ANY human. He kind of gave me a look as if to say...\\\" dude, chill, i got this.\\\" Then jestured towards the gun. When he jestured towards the gun the first words outta my mouth were... \\\"thats not gonna help.\\\" Thats when he stopped and asked me what the hell was out there. And I said bigfoot. He turned back to the door to open it and I ran and pushed him outta the way and leaned against the door to stop him. When I did that, he knew that if nothing else, at least I thought that I had seen bigfoot. My bedroom faced our backyard which had no lights to it. My room only had thin sheers to cover my windows. I could still look out my window and see, even though the sheers were drawn. For a week I slept in my bedroom floor on the opposite side of my room away from the window on the other side of my bed so that nothing outside the window would see me in my room.

My first thought was that maybe a loose horse? Then it came a little farther South on Clayton Rd. and I could clearly see a huge and thick human like shaped silhouette against the other lights from houses. I thought to myself \\\"Man that is a really big guy and he is running super fast!\\\" Then I started to think that a normal human man of that size could no way run that fast, then I thought well I've never seen a man that big!

I'm not sure a Bigfoot really has the room it might need to survive out here, but I could be wrong.

When I saw it, I turned back around in disbelief then turned around again to confirm that I did see this thing. It's eyes were a gold/yellow, it was covered in brown fur, and in a hunched position. I was so scared I couldn't move. I was frozen in fear! Just at that precise second a bus full of disabled teens with their caretakers were exiting their bus and proceeded to walk on the path a few feet in front of me. I tried to open my mouth and tell them not to go down there, but I was still in shock by what was so close behind me. Once their group had passed me I somehow got up and ran to my car which was only about 100 yards from me.

Likewise, we had only lived in this house for the same amount of time. The incident occurred on a dry, warm day in early June (late spring). It was around 9:30 PM and I was having my last cigarette of the day before getting ready for bed. I preferred smoking in our garage which is on the backside of our house attached to the basement, directly facing the woods of the ravine. I sat in a chair while I smoked and noticed it was getting dark quickly. Within a minute or two from sitting down, I suddenly began to feel really uncomfortable and could not shake the sense of another presence or the feeling of being observed from the woods. I kept looking into the trees, but it was much too shadowy and dark to make anything out. I then began to feel very nervous and a strong sense of fear developed. My heart was beating rapidly, and I was in a state of extreme vigilance. I felt powerless and vulnerable. It was an awful, dreadful terrible feeling and I could not take it anymore and quickly extinguished my smoke, shut the garage door and went into the house. I immediately felt physically safer in the house, but mentally and emotionally I was still very shaken and upset. My concern now went for my wife, who was upstairs preparing for bed. I did not want her to be scared and decided not to tell her what had happened to me. We went about our routine and finally were in bed with the lights out shortly after 10:00 PM. We were having a conversation, and while my wife was speaking my attention was drawn to sounds coming from the open window in the back room of the house (facing the woods). This whole time I was still in shock from my experience in the garage. The sounds were faint at first and were strange. I thought I could make out words, maybe even hearing my name but it did not sound right or normal. My wife had not noticed the sounds yet and was still speaking when I asked her to be quiet and listen. She heard the sounds also which were becoming more bizarre and diverse. We got out of bed and went to the back bedroom window to have a better listen. It was now pitch black outside and we couldn't see anything. The sounds began to vary from short \\\"bird calls\\\"and babbling to the sound like an infant crying to a higher pitched human-like sounding voice to escalating screaming/screeching with an unbelievable volume. The sounds were extremely disturbing and seemed to be of a supernatural, ungodly nature. Around this time we noticed a flashlight beam coming from a neighbors house. When this happened, whatever was making the screams seemed to became super agitated and the screams were now in a frenzied state. At this point, even though looking out a second floor window, we felt fearful and unsafe and shut the window and went back into our bedroom. Shortly after, we heard nothing else. The whole incident lasted about three minutes. The next day I told my wife about what had happened to me when I went out for my last smoke of the day. This whole incident left us disturbed and spooked for days since we could not come to any explanation as to what could have made the sounds other than they were supernatural and possibly demonic. About a year ago I watched \\\"Sasquatch, Legend Meets Science\\\" and as soon a I heard the supposed Bigfoot vocalizations and realized that there were sightings all across the country I believed that the sounds we heard and the presence I encountered could very well have been a Sasquatch. I discovered the BFRO website and especially researched the Ohio information. Without telling my wife my newfound possible explanation of the origin of the sounds, I played the Ohio \\\"Scream\\\" for her. Instantly chills went down her spine and she said that sounds like what we heard in the back woods. She also believes it could have been a Sasquatch that made the sounds. To this day, we both are leery of being in the backyard after dark. I have been wanting to fill out this report for some time.

The animal head we saw looked sort of like a primates, a large head with 4-6 inches of long silvery or gray hair but I don't recall much detail of the nose or mouth at the time, only a huge head that filled the window of the door. It looked in for only about three seconds, until we all had looked back at it and it apparently left.  It would have had to bend over to look in the window, since it was on the porch and the window is at the standard height.  I didn't think to look into the trees, but the odor was still very present.  We looked around, the girls yelling as if to scare away the intruder saying they would call the police.  I knew, after stepping in the scat, it was an animal and after gathering my thoughts, felt it better to get the family inside.  Also because the scat pile was fairly large, 6-7 inches diameter and about 3 inches high, thought it was a large animal but also knew from the head it was large.  My father in law is 225 lbs., 5' 10\\\" and his head was only half as big as this.  We didn't see or hear anything else.

The boys were about 13 and 8 years old at the time.  At about 0200 to 0300, the two boys got out of the tent to go to the bathroom and noticed something moving just in the shadows in a pine and cedar clump of trees about 50 ft away from their campsite.  Both boys saw the movement, then asked each other if the other had seen something.  They had both seen it.  It moved around in the shadows, and stood watching them at about 30 ft but they could only see the dark shape outlined near a tree.  He said it looked about 7 ft tall and big, standing on two feet like a man, but looked fur covered as much as they could make out in the dark.  They were scared so went back in the tent, but didn't sleep much.  Later that morning, about 0600, they were startled upright when they heard a weird howling some ways off to the west down the ridge.

In the fall of 1971 while i was in High School, it was close to the High School football Homecoming, because several of the students were at Dressers Ranch Barn preparing a Homecoming float, when several menbers of the Talihina, Oklahoma High School football team, drove up to the Barn yelling and Screaming that they had seen something in the woods on Green Hill Road. They even said that what ever it was was bigger than E.S. and had grabbed him while he was in the woods useing the Bathroom. E.S. was a Football player and was well over 6 foot 3 inches tall and weighted approx. 245 lbs. E.S. would not get out of the truck, when they got to Dressers Barn. He was white as a sheet and seem to be in some sore of shock. Another football player E.N. was shacking so bad he couldn't even zip his own pants. Several of the other football players said they were there when it happened, but didn't see anything, except E.S. running back to where the fire was, passing them and locking himself in his truck. E.N. jokeingly got his spot light out of his truck to shine it where E.S. had Come from, E.N. was holding the spot light in one hand and trying to take a wiz (leak) at the same time. E.N. said he seen it ( a large Hairy animal) standing about 20 feet from him. E.S. and E.N. were the only ones to actually see whatever it was. But they were convencing enough that the others that were there, jumped in their vehicles and drove to town which was about five miles away. Since we had One of our teachers at dressers barn with us, they came there first. After they told us what had happened, we thought they were pulling our leg (joking). But once we seen the faces of E.S. and E.N., we thought there had to be something to it. So all of us jumped into our car/trucks and headed out to Green Hill Road to see if we could See anything. Since there was a whole line of cars and trucks going out of town at the same time, the local Police seen us, and Called the highway Patrol and County deputy. they thought we were up to no good. Once we got to Green Hill Road, several of us had spot lights and were shinning out into the woods, where E.S. had been grabbed. We didn't see anything out of place. Then the Highway Patrol trooper A.T. and the County Deputy H.B. arrived to try to run us off. They did ask ,what was going on, so E.S. and E.N. told them what they had seen. After that the Highway patrol trooper A.T. and The Deputy Sheriff H.B. went out into the woods to look around. Just a few minutes later Both came back to the waiting group of High School Students , and told us, If we knew what was good for us We would get out of there. They neither confirmed or denied seeing anything. We all left to go back to town. At School the next day the topic of most conversations was the Green Hill Monster. After School C.B, B.T., F.M., J.N., J.C, F.W., A.W., O.C., R.T., M.T., E.N., B.L., all returned to Green Hill Road to have a look in the Day light.

I was just downstream of the fork in the creek that goes to your left as you're going downstream. My wife, children, mother, sister and brother-in-law were swimming and fishing about 500 feet upstream at our swimming hole. I had been noticing that my lure was running funny and was looking at it trying to fix it before making another cast. Downstream from my position, the creek makes a slight curve to the right. I was standing on rocks, as close to the waters edge as I could, fishing in the fast water just below the rapids. After messing with my lure, I looked up, toward downstream, to make another cast. When I did, I distincly saw the legs, from the mid thigh area down, (my vision was impeded of seeing anything higher than that because of tree limbs),of what I thought at the time was a man, another fisherman, about 50 feet away. It was in full stride, in the edge of the water, walking out of the water onto the bank at the right. I saw it take two steps, one from my left to my right, and another diagonally away from me, disappearing into the thicket. I remember thinking, \\\"there's another fisherman down there\\\", and continued to fish while looking to see where they went. The foliage on both sides of the creek is extremely dense in that area. Having grown up visiting my grandparents and later my parents in that area, and being very familiar with the terrain and forestation from hunting it and fishing it my whole life, I was suprised to see anyone there, that far from the bridge for several reasons. One, it was over 1000 feet downstream from the bridge and there was no car parked anywhere near the bridge, two, we had been swimming and fishing for over an hour before I had the encounter and there was noone fishing by while we were there, three, there is no residence or access by road anywhere nearer than the upstream bridge, four, the terrain is extremely rugged, full of underbrush including a thick maze of briars and poison ivy, and from experience, anyone who is there is either fishing up or downstream, five, the treck up or downstream is rugged and time consuming to trevail causing one to wade, cross at fast water areas and walk in the water on slick mossy rocks, there is nothing that would bring one to that remote area unless they were fishing. As a result, I made about three more casts while intently watching to see this \\\"other fisherman\\\" to reappear. He never did. I began to get a little spooked while thinking, \\\"What did I just see\\\"? I walked on downstream looking intently for what I saw to reappear either downstream or on the bank area where I saw it disappear. Nothing. I couldn't hear any sound other than the rapids rushing behind me. It would have been hard to carry on a conversation where I was standing when I saw it. I began to second guess myself when I couldn't see anybody or anything. Then I realized, if I saw what I that I saw, there will be water on the rocks and bank at the edge. Even though I was spooked, I decided I has to investigate any traces of something leaving the water. I waded down to where I saw it leave the water, and sure enough, there was a wet footprint on a big rock and several sprinkles on others rocks and dirt on the bank. I peered into the thicket and saw nothing but a faint trail to the other fork of the creek, probably only about 30 feet away. I decided I had seen enough, and was sure that whatever it was was there close watching me. I hightailed it back upstream to where my family was still swimming and told them the story. It wasn't until then that my mother told me about the recent sighting at Honobia, which is only about 9 miles west. I'd like to mention here that I never really believed there was any credibility in the big foot sighting stories, but I was quickly convincing myself that what I saw wasn't human. When I saw it, and I only saw it for a second, I that it was someone who was wearing dark navy blue overalls. The legs were a consistent diameter from top to bottom and I saw no indication of a human-like foot, like the pants legs extended over a persons shoe. I saw no distinction in color, it looked like a solid dark blue or black. My sister and brother-in-law had a video camera on the bank and the three of us decided to go back to the spot to see if we could get something on tape. All we got was video of the still wet rocks, and some disturbed soil where some rocks had been embedded in the dirt. It appeared that something had been sitting there. You could see indentions of where rock had been in the dirt and in the bottom of the indentions, the dirt was still damp looking, proving it hadn't been that way long. I also found a length of dung which we videoed that looked something like coyote only bigger in diameter than I had seen before from a coyote.

We stood and looked intently with night vision spot lights towards a mountain just north of us, but saw nothing unusual. Although this was the only rock throwing incident I experienced, other similar occurences were experienced by different team members over the next several days. The local land owners had reported repeated incidents like this and recently had to clean a bunch of fist size rocks from the roof of one of their buildings located at the foot of that same mountain. Nothing out of the ordinary occurred at my location during the next night\\u2019s observations. On the third night, however, I had a startling experience. We had been broadcasting bigfoot vocalizations provided by the BFRO, hoping to hear vocal responses. I was stationed about a mile away from the broadcast site, up a major creek in the area. At 7:54 PM and again at 8:20 PM, I heard sounds similar to the ones we had been broadcasting. We had heard numerous owls and coyotes, etc., and I had studied recordings of common animal vocalizations so as not to mistake them for bigfoot related vocalizations. The two sets of calls that I heard were very distant, but definitely similar to the bigfoot vocalizations the BFRO has recorded near Lake Tahoe, California. At 9:30 PM, we began our sound broadcasting protocol for the evening. Before dark, I had deployed a primate pheromone chip supplied by BFRO curator Dr. Greg Bambenek. I was sitting about 30 or 40 yards away from that chip in an elevated observation platform about 15 feet off the ground. Suddenly, at about 11:30 PM, I heard heavy foot falls in the brush to my east. They startled me because they sounded as if they were only 20 or 30 yards away and I did not hear them approach. The animal moved slowly north and south, pacing back and forth. I strained in my night vision equipment to see something, but all I saw was brush. This behavior went on and on. It was just pacing back and forth, moving very slowly. Occasionally I heard big sticks breaking under the foot falls. My mind began to race. Maybe it was a bear, or was it a sasquatch? I turned off my radio. I did not want a radio check with the creature only yards away. I kept sweeping the area alternately with night vision equipment and then natural vision. I watched for brush movement to indicate the location of the creature, but could see none. This was very puzzling since the animal sounded so close. Occasionally it would walk directly toward me. It sounded so close I leaned out and looked directly under my platform because I thought it might have slipped up to the base of the tree I was in. It did this 3 or 4 times over the next two hours.   As 1:30 AM approached (the time the last series of broadcasts were scheduled to begin), I made up my mind that I would radio the broadcast team and ask them to walk up and escort me out when the broadcasts were finished. I realized the radios might drive the animal away, but at that point I considered it a safety issue because all I knew was that some large mammal had been intently watching me for hours. I was still not sure if I was dealing with a bear or a bigfoot. The steps had been so slow and deliberate that no cadence could be detected to determine whether it was 2 footed or 4 footed. While I was talking to the broadcast team, the animal moved slowly south and then I did not hear it anymore. I waited through the last set of broadcasts, and after the last one, the team called and said they were on the way up. I had heard nothing for about the last hour, so I figured the animal had moved off, but I was not sure where it was. The team made a couple of radio checks on their way to my location. They were flashing a laser light in the tree tops and kept asking if I could see it. After one of these calls, I heard a loud \\\"Plooorp\\\" sound about 40 yards behind me and slightly to the west. My first thought was that a bear had rolled a large rock near the water\\u2019s edge. After a few seconds, I heard a more \\\"splashy\\\" \\\"plooorp\\\" sound followed immediately by foot falls racing down the water in the creek bed about 25 yds to my west. It raced past my location and up the stream about 30 yards, and then I heard nothing. There were about 12 splashing footsteps that sounded DEFINITELY BIPEDAL over a period of about 4 or 5 seconds. Upon later investigation in the daylight with BFRO curator R. N., we discovered that the creek bed was covered with boulders from 6\\\" to 18\\\" in diameter. The distance from the only pool deep enough to have been the source of the original sound to the place where the standing water ends was a distance of about 70 yds. I can offer no other suitable explanation for this event other than bigfoot. It covered more rough area quicker than anything I can conceive. The area was scouted in the daylight, but no tracks or other evidence was discovered. The next night I climbed the very same tree, but had no unusual occurrences at all except a whinnying noise we had heard before and which we had concluded during the day to be a screech owl. My sense of the situation is that the animal that walked around me may have been drawn to the area by the sound blasting, or that it may have simply happened by. Once in the area, it probably was stopped by the pheromone scent. It may have detected me while looking for the source of the pheromone scent.  I also had the zip lock bag ( that had contained the chip ) on the platform with me. It was still quite pungent.  The creature was obviously able to move stealthily since I did not hear it until it was very close.  Maybe it made noise for so long trying to draw me down from my perch, who knows? Having departed to the south, it took up a position straight downwind of both me and the pheromone chip. I made a serious mistake by picking a tree directly downwind from the chip. Perhaps if I had chosen a position 50 yds cross wind, I would not have been seen or scented. I would do it differently in the future. At any rate, this animal took up a position directly behind me, placing itself in my blind spot behind the tree I was in. It was also in my back track; maybe it hoped I would leave the same way I came. I think it waited there, still watching me, until it heard the team approaching it from behind. Then, having an unknown presence in front of it and behind it, it panicked and ran straight up the rocky creek bed where it would leave no tracks. This behavior indicates an animal that is extremely intelligent, curious, and observant. It apparently had acute night vision. It also was not afraid of me, even after hearing radio communications, a very unnatural sound. I believe it was waiting for me to come by. There is the possibility that two different animals were involved, but that would not be my first guess. Perhaps others will be able to draw more from these events. I submit this record with the hope that it will prove helpful to future efforts.\", \"location_details\": \"Land owners request that no directions be given.\", \"county\": \"Le Flore County\", \"state\": \"Oklahoma\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 3199: BFRO investigator hears loud footsteps and bipedal running\", \"latitude\": 34.52667, \"longitude\": -94.70278, \"date\": \"2001-10-02\", \"number\": 3199.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9yhskvrs3m\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-94.70278 34.52667)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Primate observed from tree stand.

Thanks to your website I have been able to concentrate much of my attention on Oklahoma, since it has many more reports than my native Kansas, which has not been updated. On that note, myself and some other interested participants traveled to Leflore County in SE Oklahoma in an attempt to find some evidence, since this area is a hotspot of reported activity. Traveling to Honobia, we met a few of the inhabitants who were more than willing to provide us with information and possible locations where we might have some type of encounter. Please note that this is near the exact location that the Mysterious Encounters team filmed the Oklahoma Wildman episode. We too visited the house where they set up operations and noted how the previous occupants had left so abruptly that most of their possessions remained in the home, including a refrigerator full of spoiled food. Having set up camp we proceeded to stay up until near dawn, occasionally playing the Sierra bigfoot vocalizations, and patroling the area. Nothing was seen or heard throughout the night. The following day, while walking through the area, myself and one other located three full footprints and one potential track on a road leading up the hillside toward the top of the hill. While we did not apply plaster-of -paris to the tracks or accurately measure them, we did take photos. Using dollar bills as gauges to measure the length not only of the footprint, but also the stride between tracks, I would quite accurately estimate that the prints themselves were over sixteen inches long and the stride nearly five and a half feet. These tracks were located on a sloping road traveling upwards at nearly 40 degrees. Also of note: I understand that many people will disregard such tracks as those of bears or other large animals, but we also took photos of bear tracks we found near the Little River located nearby. Anyone who has any idea of what animal tracks look like can tell the difference. They are not even close.

I even went to Honobia, OK with my daughter to the Bigfoot Festival in 2011 and learned a great deal.  I also want to say that I have nothing to gain by fabricating a tall tale about Bigfoot.  I have hesitated about reporting this encounter because my best friend of 40 years doesn\\u2019t believe me.  But I assure you, this really happened.  I am so excited about the encounter that we are returning to the area with our horses in a few weeks to do some investigating of our own and to trail ride some more since it rained on us all weekend this last time. We went to the Cedar Lake, Ouachita National Forest in OK.  The forecast called for rain most of the weekend but we had high hopes of doing a lot of trail riding on our horses.  My parents pulled their RV and we hauled my Dad\\u2019s horse along with ours in our stock trailer. And our camp sites were on the edge of the campgrounds, right next to the forest.  Saturday morning we went trail riding, and kept noticing a strange smell. (no one else from the camp was riding at this time, the 3 of us were alone in the woods) Smelled like musky skunk.  And a few times our horses refused to travel up certain trails. After some encouragement they finally went on.  Later that evening about 7:00pm my husband and I went to feed the horses at the camp site where our trailer was parked and saw a herd of deer passing through our camp site.  They stepped just inside the tree line and stopped.  We watched them for about 2-3 minutes then they ran off.  I took some hay down to the woods and put it on the trail hoping they would come back.  That\\u2019s when I noticed the skeletal remains of what I thought may have been a deer.  After that, my husband and I went for a walk in the woods to gather firewood before it got too dark. We didn\\u2019t get very far when my husband asked me if I had seen that? I said, see what?  He said that he saw something big and black dart across and down a hill. I told him that I didn\\u2019t see anything cause I was looking at the ground for firewood.  He was feeling very uneasy and was ready to get out of the woods so we went back to camp with a few sticks of firewood.  When we returned to camp, I was feeling kind of ornery, and decided to play upon my husbands \\u201cuneasiness\\u201d.  I took a branch and went inside the tree line and made some \\u201cwood knocks\\u201d.  It was getting dark so we got a small fire going in the fire pit.   And we were all sitting in front of the RV and talking, when we started hearing coon dogs baying as though they treed a coon.  (Could have been coyotes, I have never heard coyotes sound quite like this though.)  So I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cGreat! We have to listen to the coon hunters all night\\u201d.  My momma said that she heard a faint blood curdling scream/moan while those dogs were howling. So we made a few more wood knocks and the dog howling stopped and we never heard it again. Then shortly after that, we heard something walking in the woods, twigs breaking and leaves rustling.  We thought it was deer so we went on about our business telling ghost stories and bigfoot stories when all of a sudden  the trees in front of us started shaking violently! It sounded like something very big was coming thru the forest towards us!  Like a dinosaur movie where you see the forest moving and hear breaking of branches long before the dinosaur jumps out.  It was like that only we were not at the movies!  This was real!  We were all frozen in our lawn chairs! No one could move! We kept waiting for whatever it was to jump out at us! We could hear branches cracking, crunching and rattling and I saw the tops of the trees shaking in a circular motion.  Then it stopped.  And the forest was silent. We had a spot light and we thought about shining it in the trees but we were all to frightened!  My husband doused the fire and we all went inside the RV shortly after that.  The next morning we walked down to the trees that were shaking to look for footprints. (about 20-30\\u2019 downhill) We didn\\u2019t see anything for all the ground clutter, leaves and pine cones, twigs and pine needles.  I looked at the two trees that were shaking and they were fairly close together, I\\u2019d say about 10-12\\u201d apart at the base, they were 30\\u2019-40\\u2019 tall and about 12\\u201d-18\\u201d diameter.

However, he immediately realized that the \\\"man\\\" was projecting at shoulder level above the scattered brush that went over Richard's own head. It was \\\"dirty black, like a horse\\\", but not gleaming in the sun. It had a rounded head, no neck, arms as long as ours, lighter colored calves, a leisurely and smooth human stride, slightly tipped forward at the waist, face not visible, and it didn't make a dangerous impression. By this time Richard had stopped his tractor and climbed on the hood to see it better. The sasquatch entered a walnut grove but did not reappear as expected from the topography, so must have stopped as soon as it was hidden, Richard reasoned. When it did not reappear after a while, Richard continued with his chores of spraying.

I felt as if I were being watched. I had left camp alone and heavily armed. My friend and I were on an Elk hunting trip. As I walked through the forest, I found myself looking back over my shoulder for no apparent reason other than feeling like I was being followed. I stopped by the creek to watch the salmon and have a bite to eat. As I was eating I was watching a clear-cut area where the power lines ran down ridge. This clear cut was about seventy-five yards wide and was covered with light colored grass about knee high (2 feet). I glanced down the clear cut just as something large, dark and upright moved across from left to right. It took this thing about ten seconds to cross. It was about two hundred yards away from me. It disappeared into the trees beyond the clear cut. I thought at first it might be another hunter, but dismissed that thought when I thought about the fact that it was all dark colored and didn't appear to be carrying or packing anything. After it crossed, I picked up my rifle and scanned the area where I had last seen it. I saw nothing and put the rifle down and resumed eating. Moments later as I was watching the point where it had disappeared, it came back out. This time it was moving back to where it had first come from (from right to left). I got my scope on it, as it entered the forest again. I had a 9X scope. I was able to determine it was hairy and resembled a large man (est. 8ft tall). I could not make out any facial detail. I'm sure it did not know that I was watching it. I'm a twenty-four year career Army Veteran. At the time I was a Staff Sergeant with twelve years of service.

It was the habit of my family and several other families to reserve this campsite for a weekend in the summer. It was an infrquently available campsite, as apparently there was a desire to keep the site pristine and in original natural condition. Howard's Creek does have a forest road that ends at Howard's Creek with a turnaround circular drive aspect at the end of the road and we set up camp in part of this area circled by road. It was a bright Sunday afternoon and all the other families had left for home to be sure the kids would be ready for school. My family stayed behind not feeling we needed to get back so urgently, and decided the 4 of us would go for a walk around the circular road. Almost at the turning point fork we saw what we assumed was a huge bear, walk out from the brush from the right of the road, look our way briefly, then walk fast accross the road and crashed into the brush on the left side. The size of this \\\"bear\\\" was frightening, as I and my husband are 6 foot 3 and 6 foot 4 respectively and this animal was much bigger, probably 7 or 8 feet tall at least and very heavily built. Covered with very dark brown fur. Walking upright with arms bent. Frightened, we rushed back to camp not wanting to be prey to some kind of attack from this creature, whom we assumed was loking for leftovers after people had left camp. Estimating distance from where we were to the creature, perhaps 60 to 75  feet in front of us. It was a bright sunny day but also with shade from all the trees there. Near the camp we noticed scratches gouged deep into a tree trunk, but considerably higher than we could reach, and we assumed they were made by the animal we'd assumed was a bear. As soon as we got home, we spoke to the couple next door who had been in the camping party, to ask more about what kind of bears you get in Oregon. We had no knowledge of bears we explained, being from South Africa where there are no bears. I asked if it was a Grizzly, as that as far as I remembered was the biggest bear you got. To our surprise she informed us that no bear was as big as we described, and nor do bears walk on two feet. Had we known that what we saw was really unusual, we'd have probably got a better description by looking more carefully. I do have university training in zoology, but the best I can say is that I saw it from the side, so did not get a good look at the face even though it glanced our way briefly. It must have weighed well over 500 pounds, maybe 800, I don't think more. Hopefully Howard's Creek is a well documented place. I don't know how to find it again. It's south of Orgon possibly closer to ugene. The family nex door to us knew the way and we followed them when we went there. I don't know what year it was, but it had to be mid-seventies: We lived in Oregon 1972 to 1984, and my younger son born Aug 1973 was with us as a toddler or young preschooler.

They were at their camp around 10:00 at night when they heard a howling noise coming from the canyon below their camp site.  They later heard the sound of a large animal coming up out of the canyon towards the road near their campsite. They had dogs with them that became scared and hid in the tent.  One of the men got a rifle out of the tent and they all went onto the road to try and see what the animal was.  When the animal got onto the road, they could not see it clearly as the area was only lit by the light of the moon and the camp fire but they could see the basic outline of the animal.  They described it as being huge, maybe eight feet tall and standing on two legs.  The animal started coming towards them which, of course, scared them and the young man with the gun fired at it several times.  The animal stopped and then crossed the road and continued up the canyon on the other side of the road making a lot of noise as it crashed through the brush. I could not see much during the night so returned the next day to examine the area in day light.  I found where the animal had walked up out of the canyon and saw several areas where it had stepped in the unconsolidated rocky hill side of rock and shale and made impressions but none sufficient to identify any characteristic.  Several trees of two to three inch diameter were pushed over in the direction the animal travelled, up hill.  The distance between the foot steps was at least four feet and that was on a steep uphill walk. I did not find any evidence of the animal being hurt by the gun shots as there was no blood or fur found.  I tracked the animal up hill for several hundred yards and then lost the trail in a rocky area. I made a report of this incident and it should be on file. It should be noted that these young men were intelligent college students on a study project and when I interviewed them, were extremely scared by the incident and from my experience, I feel they were telling the truth.

The weather was clear and the ground dry. The river is approximately 50 ft wide, swift, and could be as deep as 10 feet. I had been fishing for about 15 minutes when I heard a loud branch snap across the river. In retrospect, I would say the snap sounded like a dry 3-inch branch snapping. I placed the sound about 20 feet up the bank. Since I was armed and very immobile with my bad hip, I decided to continue fishing. My thought was that there was a bear or elk in the thick brush. I kept an eye on the other bank but soon lost interest. I then heard a second loud snap similar to the first. Now, whatever it was had my attention. There was something big across the river in the brush. However, I was armed and separated by the river. I continued to fish with my eye on the other side. As I continously scanned the area, I observed what I first thought was a man move from right to left through a clearing near the source of the sound. The sighting lasted only about 3 seconds. There was no sound as \\\"it\\\" moved. My actual thought was, \\\"Oh, there's a man over there.\\\" I then thought, \\\"Damn', he was one big...\\\" I was approximately 25 yards away when I saw \\\"it\\\". As my mind digested the information I realized that what I saw had the profile of a sasquatch. I remember a barrel chest, no neck, and it was bi-pedal. I climbed back over the hill to my car to drive over to the other side. No way could I cross directly. Approximately one quarter of a mile upstream, I found a place to park and a path. The path along the river was well above the point where I spotted \\\"it\\\". Because of my hip, I could not cut through the brush to the river.

On this trip I would have 2 encounters that are up to discussion as to what they were. Let me just start by saying I'm recently a believer in Bigfoot. For several months I've been reading the case histories on the BFRO website, and frankly, I knew that the areas I'd be riding in were prime Bigfoot country. Let me also add that I had no desire to have any kind of Bigfoot encounter because I'm on a bike, I'm alone, I carry no weapon for defense, I'm often camping miles from anywhere, and I scare easily. Well, on Friday June 24th, I was up near Detroit Dam at about 9pm, and was setting up my tent. I was about a 1/2 mile from the boat marina along  what's called the upper arm of Detroit Lake, off Hwy 46, which is fed be the Breitenbush River. So its now about 9:45pm, I'm in the tent just listening to the night sounds, like the flow of the water, the leaves blowing a little in the trees, kind of just getting acclimated to where I was camping, when suddenly I hear this tremendous scream that shook me and filled me with dread. It came from about a mile away, sounded a little higher than middle pitched, like a scream a human might produce more so then an animal, but absolutely could not because of its loudness. This scream lasted about 4 to 5 seconds. It reverberated off the mountainsides in the area. What's more creepy is I was aware that a fisherman had reported to the BFRO a while back of an audible encounter. After the trip I looked it up, its #689, and sure enough this scream came from the area of the first report. I was roughly on the Northeast side of Detroit Lake, and Hoover campground is about a mile further east and south of me. Anyway, this is what I heard; it was definitely a scream and not a howl or a whoop, and frankly, if I had not heard recorded Bigfoot sounds previously, I don't think I would of known what to make of it. It was a little like the Puyallup Whoop-Howl of '73, but did not trail off at the end, was even in pitch the whole time, was louder and more like a scream. The second occurence happened on July 3rd. It was about 7:30pm; I was walking my bike along Hwy 242 (Mckenzie Pass Hwy). I was about 7 miles west of Sisters, OR. It was nice clear weather, sunny and early evening. I was walking the bike because I was too tired to ride, and it was too early to make camp. I was noticing how remote this area is. I had passed  earlier a primitive campground called Cold Springs, and was 2 miles west of it. I noticed there were no more pull-outs for cars and didn't see anything or anybody up there. A car would pass about every 15 minutes. There were trees on either side of the road. It was a very pleasent walk. Well, all of a sudden I heard 4 knocks  come from the woods just to my right about 50 feet away, behind a stand of trees and bushes. At first I thought Bigfoot, having heard wood knocking on the internet; I immediately looked at the road ahead to see if it was up, down or level. Being the bike and gear weighed 80 pounds, I would be able to make my escape only if it was down, and it was. I looked back at the area the knocks came from, and now saw one large bush suddenly shake, and then what sounded like a very low animal-like growl coming from it. At first I thought FLEE, but then thought of reports I'd read on BFRO, how people often filled with terror and ran. So I decided not to do that. I stood there and watched to see what was next, trying to act brave, and stood for about 30 seconds and thought- hell I don't really care what's next, I just wanted out, this ain't gonna be the day I investigate Bigfoot, I actually said to myself -  maybe I'd comeback some other day. So I started walking off, and nothing else happened. I camped about 2 miles west from there. I should say to me this did not sound like a woodpecker, which is often high up in the trees, is faster and more in number of strikes, and is higher pitched. What I heard was four knocks, evenly spaced, coming from about ground level, the sound like that of wood on wood. No one was in the area, no development, it being preserved, protected wilderness. So what made that sound?\", \"location_details\": \"To reach first location, take Hwy 22 for about 48 miles to Detoit, turn north on Hwy 46 and go 1/2 mile.

My husband and I had just put our oldest son to bed, and were settling down to watch TV in our living room.  My husband heard \\\"someone\\\" screaming \\\"bizarrely\\\", very loud far off across our lake, so he opened our back sliding door to get a better listen.  That was when we both heard a, maybe 3 at a time, organized pattern of what can only be described as roaring screams. We knew immediately they were not human.   I had heard the Klamath audio before and this made my hair stand on end because it was exactly the same.  This animal was closer, just across a 6 acre or so lake/pond. We heard probably a total of 4, 3-at-a-time, scream patterns. The individual screams were alarmed, but not frantic.  It seemed to be almost 'responding' to dogs barking.  The 'runs' were all about .5 - 1 second apart.  The interval in between patterns was probably 1 minute or so. All was quiet for about 3 minutes and somewhere in the dark across the lake we heard something very, very large and strong tussle successfully with a dog. At the end of the tussle the dog let out a sharp yelp and we heard a thud.  At that point we (I flipped out) shut the door, locked all the doors, sawed a serious dowel for our back slider, turned on our kids white noise machines and went to listen from another part of the house.  We heard a few more screams but it sounded farther away at this point and then seemed to go away. Whatever tangled with that dog was extremely fast, extremely large and very strong.  Based on what we heard, it sounded like the creature must have either approached or walked past a tied up dog.  We heard a quiet small scuffle probably as the dog tried to bite it.  Then an enormous amount of thudding, bushes rustling, and a loud pained yelp and a thud. All was quiet after that and we heard some quiet splashing in the lake.  The splashing could have been disturbed waterfowl, however.  It was pitch black and we were looking out our back sliding doorway into the blackness basically just trying to listen when this occurred.  The tangle with the dog occurred about 3 minutes after we heard the vocalization pattern.  In total, the vocal pattern seemed to be moving slowly from the northwest end of the lake to the northeast end, where we believe the dog incident occured. I have a BS in zoology from the University of Washington and a considerable amount of outdoors experience.  I have heard all different types of animal calls, screams, etc... I'm even quite good at discerning the subtle differences between a Beluga whale click and a porpoise call. I have perfect pitch and a well trained ear from years of classical voice training.  This was most certainly a primate type call, almost with a Siamang type quality to it. It was most definitely not human, and I'm certain it was not any other animal common around our area (coyote, deer screaming in pain, rabbit, fox, racoon, other).  It was extremely similar to the Klamath falls recording only louder and closer, and it scared me more than anything I've ever encountered.  My husband and I discussed our observations at length.  There is honestly no other explanation for this type of call and activity, though we understand how rare and extraordinary this must be because we live in a settled area near freeways and quite honestly we've never really considered \\\"bigfoot\\\" before much more than \\\"what a neat theory!\\\" Let me just state again that this was not human.  Not even close. Even a human trying to imitate something like that would have had a 'narrower', more nasal sound as a human just doesn't have the head/throat size to accomplish such volume and tone.  Further, it had a squeal and roar quality at the same time, like nothing I've ever heard except the various recordings, in particular the Klamath.  Also a human scream would have had some identifiable emotion to it (drunk, scared, angry etc...) as humans we're quite good at picking up on tones of other humans.  This had none of that.  It was entirely foreign to us. Update: this morning as I look through my binoculars across the lake, exactly where we heard the dog tussle incident, the neighbor's canoe dock is destroyed.

In these areas I saw and photographed trees that are snapped off in an unusual manner.\", \"location_details\": \"Gated forest road # 7 on north side of highway 18 about two miles west of Grande Rhonde, OR\", \"county\": \"Polk County\", \"state\": \"Oregon\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 3064: Bowhunter finds twisted trees, tracks, scat, & unusual sounds\", \"latitude\": 45.07072, \"longitude\": -123.6664, \"date\": \"2001-09-01\", \"number\": 3064.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c2003uugup\", \"temperature_high\": 73.53, \"temperature_mid\": 60.035, \"temperature_low\": 46.54, \"dew_point\": 54.61, \"humidity\": 0.71, \"cloud_cover\": 0.74, \"moon_phase\": 0.46, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.73, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 229.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.39, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.6664 45.07072)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I may have stumbled onto a print by pure accident, while hiking with my niece and nephew in the Siuslaw Natl. Forest, west of Dallas, Or. I will give details of the location later, as not to saturate the site with the public, so I can finish my investigation in the area and get more readings and data... GPS, photos, and history on the area...  Here is what I have thus far.... On the mid afternoon of 24 July, I took my niece age 13, and nephew age 16, to an area I used to hunt and log about 30 years ago west of Dallas, Oregon. Thirty years has changed the area quite a bit as Weyerhauser has bought up a lot of the land, Boise and Hampton Co. as most of the area is logged out, there is still a large standing area of some old growth and an area in which to hike. We were not 15 min. out from my truck on a trail and my nephew blurted out... \\\"Uncle Ron, look at this foot print!\\\"  Off the trail a foot or two was a large print made in dried mud, (the last rain in the area was about 6 July 2003), so the print was well defined and clear as the photo shows. Several things I noticed about the print, 1) It was not a boot print as no boot tracks were showing, the print was smooth, consistent with a bare foot print. 2) The width was about 9 inches wide at the largest width, and about 14 inches long. 3) Toe contours could clearly be seen, but it looks like what ever made he print may have stepped on a twig, wood, so not all the toes made an imprint in the mud, as the casting shows. 4) The foot print clearly shows a heel print, and arch in the foot, the edge of the foot at wide proportions from a very heavy individual. 5) As the trail is used lightly by mountain bikers and horses, as seen by tracks on the trail. Our 5 hours up on the trail, I only saw one mountain biker that day while in the area. So, it is not used that much, maybe only by locals who live in Dallas or people who know the area. I attempted to make GPS readings that day, but for some reason, my GPS could not pick up satellite signals possibly from the heavy canopy of trees. Another attempt for a long/lat reading with negative results on a second trip. I will attempt a 3rd trip with new batteries and see what happens. The print was, as I said, left of the trail, going SSW. I searched the area for about 2 hours, hair samples on trees, scat, or other prints in area...negative results...photos of area were taken from different perspective points. At this point, as I dont want to \\\"contaminate\\\" the area with undue traffic, I will keep the exact location confidential until I complete my investigation.  Now a little history on the area. I have hunted the Falls City and Dallas area since 1970. In 1972, while heading to Falls City, Or. my friend Rick swerved to miss something darting across the road... I was a witness to something large, tall and running on two legs, not four....thinking it may have been a bear, or a crazed hunter dressed in black... we both, as teenagers could not answer what we saw... The stories we had heard is, that the Dallas and Falls City area from old timers, and hunter friends of ours, stories of BIGFOOT circulated during that time... especially after the famous RED BLUFF, Ca. film clip of the famous Roger Patterson... from 1967. As the photo shows I took a casting of the footprint, as mentioned, only one was found thus far. Within the next few days I will attempt to return to the area for further investigation and findings. Will keep you posted... You do have my permission to post this report and photos... At this point, \\\"undetermined what made the print\\\" At his point only two other Bigfoot Research Websites have been contacted on this sighting, no response as of yet. My friend RAY CROWE has highly recommended your site and organization for years. I first met Ray Crowe at a seminar he did on BIGFOOT in 1994. I am also a good friend of Lyle Vann of the Arizona Bigfoot Center Paulden, Az.\", \"location_details\": \"West of Dallas, Or. off Ellendale rd.

I left Portland at 3 am and had only had coffee and donuts to eat; there were not many other cars on the road at all, none that were going in a westerly direction that were within sight of me and only about 2 cars passed me between Spirit Mountain Casino and the site were I had my sighting. I was driving about 55 mph and had my bright lights on  and had just came over a rise in the road shortly after you start down the back side of Murphy Hill summit. As I crested the rise out in the distance I saw what I thought at the time was a deer on the left shoulder of the road about 200 yards out from me.  I slowed down to 40 mph or so because I didn't want it to jump in front of me or if there were other deer in the area I might spook them into the road. As I got within 75 yards the object began to move across the road from left to right, that is, when I saw that it was not a deer and I thought it might be a bear which I have seen cross a road before but this was way different. The object was hunched over slightly and was on two legs and cleared the road in about 4 steps. The best way to describe the color was dark brown to black and I would guess the hair to be 4 or 5 inches. The arms looked to come down to mid thigh area. I did not see the face except for there seemed to be a deer-like shine coming from the face area. The height was about 7ft + as it disappeared over the edge of the road to the right. I was about 50 yards away by this time. I was starting to feel pretty weird like this was something I had never seen. Hard to explain the feeling as I passed the spot where it went over the bank I tried to look over and see where it had gone. I was going about 25 mph now as I went about 20 yards past the spot and stopped I then reversed my car to the spot where I had seen it go over the bank. I stopped my car and left the engine running I had my window rolled down slightly for air flow as I was driving. When I stopped I could smell a musty type smell not real bad but strong enough to notice. I could hear some movement in the brush but not a lot because of the car noise and the fact that my window was only down 2 or three inches on the left side when the object was now on my right.  I had a really strong feeling that I was being watched; every hair on my body was rigid, I had goose bumps over my whole body I have them now as I write about this, not as bad but the chills. I decided then that it would be a really good time to leave so I drove off as fast as my Metro would go I made it to Lincoln City at 6 am and had about 10 cars pass me going east on hwy 18 in that time.When I got there I went to my girlfriend's to get my bag and was going to come right back to Portland to work. Instead I stayed until 9 am then left to go back to Portland. As I drove by the spot I thought about stopping but decided against it.  I know the area well though because I helped a lady who had rolled her car off the road in the same are many years ago. The bank in the are is about 7 ft down on both sides and is swampy in some places. I lived in Lincoln City for many years and have spent time in the woods alone and with others and have never felt or seen anything like this  I don\\u2019t know what to make of it except for it being Bigfoot. No bear walks on its back legs like this.

When it started getting dark we decided to circle back to the pick up; we were approx. 2 miles away on the top end of the mountain along the east side of the ridge line. I had forgotten to bring my flashlight so my buddy had to shine his light for both him and I while we walked out. During the walk while we were crossing the top of the ridge we could notice an awful smell; the smell was kind of moldy or musky so we thought it was probably just a bear that had gotten into some swampy skunk cabbage or something similiar. We continued to notice the terrible smell off and on all the way back to the truck. While on the top end of the ridge I managed to step into a very large hole that was in the rocks; somehow I managed to grab onto something to keep myself from falling completely in the hole as it was big enough for me to fall completely in it. If you consider the fact that I'm 6 ft tall and weigh around 210 pounds you had to figure that the hole or cave had to be pretty good sized; unfortunately, since I didn't have a flashlight I couldn't see what it looked like very well and yes, that smell was also present at the time. When we finally got back to the old alder road where our truck was parked, we could still notice the awful smell every now and then; one other thing that we noticed was the very large footprints that had been left in the muddy dirt on the road. Now these footprints were approx. 16 inches long and looked alot like a mans footprint but what had really made us uncomfortable and nervous was the fact that these footprints were directly in our tire tracks that was made from our drive into the area a few hours earlier. As we looked at them we both thought there had to be a logical explaination; we tried to simply write them off as being bear tracks but deep down we both knew that they weren't made by a bear. These tracks were much too large to be a bear track plus, they didn't have the 2 separate pads that a bear track leaves. I've killed 4 black bears, one of which was 6 1/2 ft tall and nothing in the way of tracks ever looked like these tracks did. Both my friend and I have lived here all our lives; we both are avid hunters and are well known in the area for our hunting success. My friend works in the woods and has done so all his life and for that reason alone, we chose to not say anything about this for quite some time. It was only within the last few months that I had told my brother's friend about what had happened and it wasn't too long after that when he happened to run into my buddy and asked to tell him what had happened. He was amazed at how we both were able to recall things that had happened 13 years ago in such detail; I told him that you don't forget something like that because when it happens, it stays with you forever. We never saw anything that night in the way of a live animal but we both felt as if we were being followed or watched the whole time; it made us uneasy, to the point that we left as soon as we could get to the truck. I've been back to that area once or twice but I have never seen anything else although there have been some recent incidents that would indicate that there is indeed something up there. My brother heard a god awful scream not too far from there this past elk season; he also heard a large tree crash down without there being any strong winds blowing that would cause that to happen. There are a couple reports on your website that are only a few miles as the crow flys from where we were. I would be willing to talk to someone if they feel that they would like to however, I would like to keep my name and the exact location private if possible. Additional details about the tracks fround in their tire tracks: Scott,  As I recall, we really didn't notice anything until after we had already gotten back to the pickup. I was taking a leak a few feet behind the truck when I really paid any attention and noticed what looked like a footprint in the mud; I didn't have a light so I had my friend shine his light on the road as we walked back down a ways. What we first saw wasn't a full complete track so at first we just thought it was a probably nothing more than a bear track. It was only after we went back for a ways that we were able to notice that some of the tracks were in our tire tracks and of the ones we seen we could only identify one of those footprints that showed it completely from heel to the toes; what we also thought was weird was the fact that it looked as if it was spread out it was in a really straight line; what I mean is that where the prints showed in the mud it was like whatever it was that was walking it looked as if it had been walking on a tightrope or something, if that makes any sense. we only went back about 50 yards from the pick up and I would say that we could see about 5 or 6 partial tracks where there was mud that showed something; the one complete track we saw was near a large mud puddle where the ground stayed wet enough for there to be a large mud hole across the whole road; we really couldn't notice anything where the road was made up of grass and gravel. The one complete track we did see was actually the track that had been furthest away from our pick up; when we saw that track we both looked at each other and made some kind of comment as to we didn't really believe what it was was that we were looking at and at that point we both were ready to get the hell out of there. When we were up hunting on the hill and even when we were walking out we never put things together, like the smell we had experienced off and on as we walked out or the tracks as possibly being related until after we started down the hill and went home; like I said before, we thought when we were walking out that the smell was probably just a musty old bear; just like we thought those tracks were until we saw the one furthest away from the truck. I hope that helps you; it's been awhile so if I'm leaving anything out or think about something, I don't think I have but if I did I'll be sure to let you know.

We spent 3 weeks in the state and I was lucky enough to see what I think was Bigfoot. We had camped in an area that was dense and close to a shallow river. It was almost like the camp was a bald spot with a wall of brush and trees around it. There was a trail that led to the shallow river and although it probably wasn't far, seemed so to me. The late afternoon was sunny and warm and everyone but my cousin, my uncle, and myself went to look for herds of elk or antelope. We had campers to sleep in, and my uncle and my cousin were both napping when this sighting occured. I was outside one of the campers playing when I heard a rustling of underbrush.I never smelled anything that I can remember, or heard a sound other than the rustling. When I looked up, I noticed that a small sapling...maybe the size of the end of a baseball bat, just bent completely over.This sapling was behind a thick wall of what appeared to be some sort of a berry bush. I am not sure what kind, though. I was curious and walked over to where I had seen the sapling bend over, thinking that there was a squirrel hanging on to it or something. That is when a large hand reached out from behind this brush and grabbed a handful of berries. I had to be 8 or 10 feet away at the time. The hand was huge with long reddish brown hair. It was clear that it was a hand and NOT a paw. I stood there in total shock.When I managed to run, I ran for my life. It did not chase me or anything, but I saw all that I wanted to see of it. The hand was scary enough, I probably would have died of fright had I seen the rest of it. I got back into camp which was not far away, but far enough for my napping cousin and uncle not to hear anything. I never screamed or made a sound, I just ran and sat as close to that camper as I could. I realized when I sat down in the fine dirt that I had wet my shorts.I was 7 years old and I had never done that before! I kept my mouth shut until my Mother and my other uncles and aunts (That were from Oregon) got back from antelope/elk sightseeing. I told them everything and they told me that it had to have been a bear. I described the color of the hair and I was told that it must have been black hair that I had seen, because this area only had black bears. I wasn't stupid. I knew the difference between a hand and a paw and the difference between reddish brown and black. I managed to let them convince me that it must have been a bear and we left and came back to our home state of Mississippi. A few years later I was in 6th grade. We had a library period and we could look for and check out books. I found a book with a black cover and if I am not mistaken, the title was \\\"Bigfoot\\\". I hurried to check this book out and read it from cover to cover. It wasn't until that moment that I figured out that the animal that I had seen those years earlier had a name. I had never been so excited in my life! Ever since, I have been interested in all sightings, shows, books, etc. of the Bigfoot/Sasquatch/Yeti/Skunkape. I have thought about telling my story for years, but I, like everyone else, have been afraid of the teasing and skeptisism of others. My family says \\\"We believe that YOU believe what you saw.\\\" I will believe it until the day I die. I am 29 now and I hope that the mystery will be solved in my lifetime. My husband and my son believe me more than my Mom, Dad, Aunts, Uncles and cousins. I am very genuine and honest and I would never lie about something like that.

It was gently rubbing fingers through my beard, not as if it was intending to wake me, only trying to figure out who or what I was. I would liken it to a blind person touching the contours of your face to try and \\\"see\\\" you. For some reason I was thinking of a squirrel or other critter. I did noticed an odor like burnt hair and decomposing meat. Very strong. I sat up and roared to spook whatever it was, away. It took off into the heavy brush in an area where it didn't have to cross dirt/gravel. I could hear it crashing through the brush on two legs. It was big and heavy, very noticable.

We were on some logging roads, or they may have just been fire control roads put there by the BLM, but anyway we were on a curve in the road.  We knew there were probably other people in the area, and so we each posted a 'watch-out' while the other of us did our business.  Anyway, I was watching out for her, and walked a little way back down the road the way we had just come... when I heard a noise. I looked up just in time to see what I thought must have been a bear.  It was just across a clearing across the road coming down a very steep embankment.  It was near the top, very dark brown or black in color and was crashing down the embankment through some smaller trees, in an upright position.  I know it was not a man. It did not have clothes on or anything like that. It was big and hairy. it started from the top of the steep embankment and crashed downwards almost in our direction. I could hear the thump thump thump thump of its steps very clearly along with all the crashing of the brush.

I was yelling bear! bear! bear! and we both hurried off in the other direction.  She asked me what I saw and I told her; we speculated on it for much of the rest of our long hike.  I had convinced myself that it must have been a bear.  Later that night I told my father about our close call with the bear and when I told him what I had saw and what it did... he told me it must have been a man because bears did not ever walk upright and definitely not upright down a hillside.  that is when I came to the conclusion that it must have been a big foot.

We headed for the state of Oregon in August 1979 for a possible long term stay. After a 5-day drive we came to the small town of Drain, Oregon, where Jimmy had been a few years earlier with his ex-wife and child. After about 3 weeks we settled in and everything was looking pretty good for us. A couple of months passed by and one early morning in October 1979 I got up and asked my brother Jimmy if he knew of a place to go deer hunting. He told me that he had been to a place a few years ago just outside a small town called Yoncalla, Oregon, a few miles south of Drain on HWY 99. So we took off to go check out the area he told me about. We drove south of yoncalla about 2-3 miles and turned to the west on an old logging road. We went up the road for about 2 miles and came to a fork in the road, at that time I ask Jimmy, do I go right or left? He told me it doesn't matter. So I turned right and the road ended at the top of a mountain about 2 more miles up. The road that turned left at the fork ended at the top of a mountain about 300-500 yards away to be left. Jimmy and I got out of the car for a nature call, after about 20 seconds Jimmy told me to look over on the other mountain top, he saw something move. I looked and I told him that I didn't see anything. About 10 seconds later Jimmy told me, look I saw something move! I looked and told him that, I.., and that's all I could say. At that time we saw a BIG black thing walking like a man.  It walked over to the edge of the other mountain, the mountain we would have been on if we had taken a left at the fork in the road. It was standing there for about 10-20 seconds before it walked back to where we first saw it.  When it stopped, it turned and looked at us for about 30 seconds, then turned away.  That's when we saw a little one standing there beside it. We watched as they walked away from us over the mountain. They were about 300 to 500 yards away from us; the big one was about 6-7 feet tall and about 300-400 pounds; very muscular.  The smaller one was about 4-5 feet tall and probably about 100 to 150 pounds. After we got over the shock, Jimmy and I left and drove down to the fork in the road and saw a man on a horse.  We stopped and asked the man if his horse was acting funny or if he saw anything strange? He pulled out a BIG pistol and told us he was not worried about it. I think that the Big Foot was looking at him, when it walked over to the side of the mountain and looked down. We stopped in the town of Yoncalla to get something to drink and told some of the people there and they did not care to talk about it, so we left. I hope you take this story seriously, because you are the first that I'vetold it to in a long time. I have always wondered why me, why did I see it. Charles A.

It began to sound as if a cow was beying, a very deep gutteral sound advancing into a howl that lasted about 5-10 seconds.  At first I was dismissing it as one of the neighbors cows, but my cousin said she had never heard it before and the end of the vocalization sounded more like a wolf than a cow.  I yelled for my younger cousin to come back inside, she had frozen in place when the sound started, and we locked the door - something that they never do because the location is so rural.  I had never been so frightened by a noise in my life.  What ever it was sounded very large and I was in doubt that the locked door would stop it if it decided to investigate it's surroundings.  It sounded very close, but we were located in a valley, and because of the echo it was hard for me to figure out exactly how close it really was.  Two nights later I heard it again, this time I was alone on the dirt road that connects the \\\"highway\\\" to the properties on the Mountain.  I was walking to the bridge that covers a creek that seperates the properties when I heard it again, starting low and growing to a high-pitched howl.

It was approximately 2:30 am, on a Saturday morning.  I was driving south on Interstate-5 and it was raining lightly.  The area is known as Rice Hill, about a half hour north of Roseburg, Oregon.  Heading south, the highway runs up rice Hill, sweeps to the west across the top, and then turns back to the south as it drops off.  As I crested the hill, and was exiting the the turn to the west, my headlights came level with the road and the guard rail, along the turn to the south.  Right at the point of curve, of the turn to the south, right next to the guard rail, was a bigfoot.  It was crouched down, kind of squatting, like a baseball catcher, untill my headlights were right on it, and then it stood up, quickly, took a step or two and jumped the guard rail, and went down the enbankment.  At 65 mph, I didn't see it for long, especially at night; however, there is no doubt that it was the stereotypical bigfoot.  Needless to say, I was quite surprised, and I pulled over.  My stopping distance, at that speed, put me downhill from the spot quite a way.  I was carrying a .44 magnum pistol with me, and thought about going back up on foot to look for sign, but I was a little rattled at the time, and opted not to.  I sat there for probably 5 minutes, and then continued home.  I told friends and family, but have never contacted any organization about the incident.  The only issue I have with this sighting is that is was within 4 days of Halloween (before or after, I don't remember).  That being said, I still don't quite know what to think about it. The bigfoot, as I said, was the stereotypical bigfoot.  Dark brown, shaggy, little or no neck, long arms, and stood on two legs.  Having seen many bears in the wild, I'm certain it was not a bear.  Its ability to jump a guard rail in two steps was not anything a bear could do.  It didn't seem huge to me, however, when I stand next to a guard rail, it comes up to the top of my knee (I'm 5'8\\\"), so it must have easily been in the 6'+ range.  I never got to see its face, mostly the back and a bit of its left side.  All I can say is that it looked like Chewbacca from the back.

It was about midnight. I was driving on hwy 138 heading east about 15 miles out of Roseburg, Oregon. As I rounded a curve in the road, I saw what I thought was a deer way up ahead crossing the road. I slowed down a bit as I got to where I thought the deer would be. What I saw was a figure standing just off the road by a fence with one hand on the fencepost and it turned as I went by, watching me. I thought It was a man so I stopped to see if he needed help. I got out of my truck with my flashlight in hand and started walking back toward the \\\"man\\\". I was working the lightbeam along the fenceline when I heard the most godawful sound I've ever heard in my life! I froze. I was in the military and I work as a psychiatric nurse and I don't scare easily but that scream scared the crap out of me. It sounded like a dying calf in a hail storm..It was ranging in tone, starting out high pitched, then ending up as a threatening, low pitched, guttural sound. I dropped my flashlight and RAN back to my truck and spun tires getting out of there. The next day on my way to work, I stopped at the same spot. My flashlight was still there. I didn't notice any footprints but did see the tall grass had been walked through on the other side of the fence. I looked on all the fence posts in the area where I saw it but did not see any evidence of hair. As to what it looked like, I only got a brief look as I went by, but it had to be at least 7 foot tall. I base this on the fact that I drive a Dodge Ram truck; when I'm sitting in the driver's seat, my head is 6 feet off the ground. The spot where this thing stood is in a depression in the ground. When I park my truck in that spot and stand where it stood, I can't see into the cab at all. And yet, that night I saw it, its head was even with mine, I was looking directly out the window not slightly up or down. I couldn't make out features as it was dark but the lights of my pickup slightly illuminated the area where it stood as I went by. As I said, I thought it was a man at first who needed help. It looked so human at that moment, it wasn't until later that I came to believe it couldn't have been a man. No man could have made that sound. What I remember seeing was a figure standing next to the fence. Its head followed me as I went by. It didn't appear to have shoulders, it looked like the head just spread out until it became shoulders. It appeared to have long hair all over; at first I thought it was a long jacket like a duster, but as I look back it had to be fur. But it was the scream that stands out in my mind.

Suddenly i heard something coming down the hill through the burned trees. it sounded like another hunter, only it was being very loud. I stood up to try and see what it was but the wind picked up and blew my scent toward it. The sound stopped for a few seconds and it turned and ran back up the hill. I ran out the road to try and see what it was. By this time it had reached the top and was running upright along the ridge. I caught three or four glimpses through the burned trees before it went over the ridge. About 10 seconds later I heard two loud screams like before. My friend called me on the radio to ask if I heard it and to tell me he was heading in. I walked further out the road to meet him. As we were talking about it, we heard it once more.

We pulled into a forest Service campground named Eagle Rock and found we were the only ones in the campground. The campground is situated right alongside what I believe is the Umpqua River. There are steep mountains on both sides so I guess you would say we were at the bottom of a canyon. The water was running over a lot of rocks next to our site and made a lot of noise. My brother decided to pitch his tent next to the river and I slept in my van in the parking spot. As darkness fell, we sat out in the dark talking about our lives. This was the first time we had been together in about 20 years so we had a lot of stories to tell. While we were was talking,I heard something making a weird calling noise from the mountain across the river from us. I wasn't sure until I heard it a second time. Since my brother was talking at the time, he didn't hear it. We eventually headed off to our respective beds. My brother woke up at 0200. He said he was checking his watch fo the time when he heard 2 loud hoots from across the river about 50-100 yards downstream. He called them hoots but said it wasn't really a hoot. He couldn't really describe or imitate the sound. They had to be very loud to be heard over the noise of the river. He laid frozen in his sleeping bag then heard something walking around the campsite. About that time something woke me up. I heard something moving around outside the van and was about to raise the windowshade to peek out when I heard what sounded like a gorilla grunting next to my van. I have no real experience with gorillas and have only heard them on nature shows on TV, but that's what I heard. Needless to say I was too afraid to lift the shade at that point. After a while, it got quiet (except for the river noise) and somehow we both fell back asleep. When it finally got light we came out, compared notes and started looking for any tracks. The ground was too hard and the river too rocky to show us any. I also checked the campground to see if there were any other campers there, but there were none. We don't think it could have been deer or elk because it was right in the middle of hunting season and hunters are all over the place up there. I don't think any deer or elk would come into a human camp at that time of year. When we got home we listened to the recordings on the site.

My first introduction to Big Foot was about 1965.  A series of articles appeared in the Portland Oregonian, the Salem-Statesman Journal, the San Francisco Chronical, and at least one other. I saved these articles in a folder as sort of a Jr. High science project.  We even talked about it in class a couple of times with much scoffing by the teacher even though he did say there are many things which science does not understand, or has even discovered. One of the articles from the Chronical stated that a young bigfoot had been captured in the late 1880's and put in a freak-side show. According to the article could break a stout hard wood stick about 3 - 6 inches in diameter like a matchstick.  For some reason or other it died and the body disposed of.  How it was disposed of or where, was unknown.  Apparently the animal was in the sideshow in a steel barred cage for a few years.  Just how many years that few was is also unknown. An artists drawing was also printed and supposedly dated back to the time this thing was caged.  According to the newspapers these articles were dated back to the 1880's. There was also a story from the Oregonian that a well known scientist from the University of Oregon had announced he was going to attempt contact with these beings by parachuting into the wilderness somewhere between Grants Pass and the Kalmiopsis Wilderness area..  I believe that in the late 1970s or early 1980s, an expedition was formed to go out and look for the scientist. I remember reading that remnants of his tent and a very old campsite were found, but there was no sign of the scientist himself.  Who knows! There were also stories about mysterious attacks that occurred during the construction of Interstate 5 near the top of Mount Ashland.  In 1964-65, Workers found several earth movers with the tires and wheels completely ripped off the machines.  HUBS and all.  A man who had been a close friend of my familys' in Klamath Falls before we moved to Ashland, worked at Pape Cat in Medford.  They had the contract to repair and maintain the equipment used for construction on the road.  He told us that (this was confidential) something had ripped the wheels off, AND 55 gallon drums had holes punched in them like a big fist.  He said the state police were investigating vandalism, but since it would have been very hard for any humans to get to the equipment and no human had that kind of strength or ability, they were not sure what they were dealing with.  The investigation died for lack of evidence and construction continued.  It was not an isolated case.  That same kind of incident happened three or four times.  Then, AFTER the highway was completed into California, the story was told of a man  traveling North in a blinding snow storm over the top of the Siskiyou Pass or summit.  He claims he was headed down the mountain towards Ashland when suddenly something landed on the hood of his car.  The snow was more like a blizzard and the headlights were reflected back at him.  He saw a shape like a human, and a face looking at him through the windshield.  He thought he had hit someone.  After a second or two, the thing rolled over and off the hood disappearing into the snow and the night.  When the man got to the South Ashland Exit, he went into a gas station.  He told the attendant to fill it up while he got a cup of coffee.  He was really rattled, and did not tell anyone he had probably killed a person.  When he came back with coffee, the attendant asked how the hood on the car had gotten such a huge dent right in the middle and he wondered what all the hair around the edge of the hood was.  At least, to the attendant, it looked like hair.  Those, such as they are, were the stories reported in the newspapers in 1965 and 1966.  Check the Ashland Daily Tidings.  My first experience with bigfoot came in early 1966.  A friend and I, both 15, decided to hike up the old Ashland Mine Road.  We had a Boy Scout camp coming up in April or May of that year and wanted to prepare for a 5 mile hike we knew was coming.  My mother drove us to the top of Mountain Street where the Ashland Watershed is.  We found fresh snow on the ground about 3 or 4 inches deep.  There were other people sledding.  My friend and I began hiking.   The snow was fresh and there were NO TRACKS IN THE SNOW AHEAD OF US.  Remember that.  NO TRACKS ....PERIOD! We hiked up the road with many twists and turns as it climbs up the mountain side. Near the end of the second mile, we came to a climbing right hand 90 degree turn.  As the road leveled out we came upon some tracks.  BIG tracks.  My friend and I stopped and looked around thinking perhaps some other human was in the area.  But as we compared our prints side-by-side with those we found, we realized these were not human.  There was about a 3-4 inch difference in foot size. I wore an 11 size boot.  In other words, these tracks were HUGE in  comparison. They were not bear tracks.  And the strides were not human either.  From the tip of the toes to the heel of the footprint ahead, was about 9 - 10 feet.  It was hard to measure since we were not carrying a measuring tape NOR were we expecting anything like THIS!  When we put the heel of our boots next to the toe of the footprint; and stepped off the distance between THE PRINTS it was nearly three paces, or 9 feet .   We tried to stretch our steps to match, but there was no way we could reach that far in one single step. We observed what appeared to be three pads at the front of the print, sort of like pads a dog has under its claws.  One was kind of shaped like a peanut, but I can not remember which side of the foot the pad was.  Either the right front quadrant or the left front.  Anyway, we began to get frightened.  The hair on our necks was standing up and we both got the creeps.  My friend looked at me and said I will bet these are big foot tracks;  I said it could not be, not this close to civilization, especially since down the hill to our left about three quarters of a mile were some secluded homes on the Southern edge of Ashland.   My friend looked at me and said the area where we were standing was considered rugged mountains and bigfoot lives in areas like that.  That did not help my frame of mind any. We observed  the animal had come down a 10 - 12 foot embankment, about a 15 degree incline.  We both began to suspicion someone was playing tricks on us, but we could not figure out who since no one except our parents knew we were out there.  We plucked up our courage and continued on up the road following the foot prints.  We followed the tracks about another two miles.  As we came up around another climbing 90 degree turn to the right we observed the tracks had stopped and the animal appeared to be looking back down the road towards us.  We then observed little clumps of snow rolling down the 8 foot embankment to our right.  And the bushes at the top were wiggling.  The brush at the top of the embankment was pretty thick and this thing could be hiding behind the brush up there.  We took one look at the tracks, the snow coming down embankment and the moving brush, AND realized that what ever it was had JUST JUMPED UP the hill.  There were no tracks from the side of the road to the top of the embankment.  We decided to,  as they say in the Army, UnA- - the area.  We departed in haste, over the highside; to our left and down the hill as far and as fast as we could go.   We decided not to mention this to anyone because they would not believe us.  My next encounter came a few months later.  As my friend and I prepared to go on this Boy Scout outing we pledged to keep our silence about the previous experience.  In late March or early April of 1966 we went with our Boy Scout leaders, one of whom worked for the U.S. Forest Service.  We went out into the woods behind Talent Oregon.  It was somewhere around 30 miles or so into the brush; as we liked to call it.  Out there is an old trapper's cabin that the Forest service used as a shelter or a campsite when doing surveying work.  The building itself was said to be historic but usable.  We set up our tents within 20 - 30 yards of the cabin, but my friend and I got into an argument with the leadership and decided to put our tent on the far side of the cabin by ourselves.  We had a meeting around a big campfire when it got dark, we ate dinner and then the leaders decided to take us on a snip hunt;.  After about an hour or so, of wandering around in the brush for several hundred yards, much shouting and yelling, we headed back to the camp. My friend and I built a campfire outside our tent and roasted some marshmallows.  The leader came by and told us to get to bed as we needed some sleep for the 5 mile hike the next day.  As we got into our sleeping bags, my friend made the remark that he hoped no bigfoot(s) would bother us.  That got my attention.  About 30 minutes later we were snuggling into our bags when this big shadow went between the fire and our tent.  We both saw what appeared to be a shaggy-somewhat stooped over figure walk between the fire and the tent.  At that point we got very acquainted with the bottom of our sleeping bags.  We laid there wide awake and SCARED to death.  At one point I noticed that my sleeping bag was under the tent, OUTSIDE of the tent.  I scooted back up as far as I could go to get back inside when my air mattress scraped across a nail sticking out of the back pack and POW; the mattress exploded.  It scared the .... out of us both and my friend nearly killed me.  It is funny now and you can laugh at is now, but then it was terrifying.  I was afraid this Thing; outside was waiting to get me.  As I look back on it now, I realized that IF it was a bigfoot, its curiosity was simply that....curiosity.  IF indeed it was a bigfoot, it simply went between the fire and the tent on its way to somewhere else. Very early in the morning, near daylight, we heard a banging in the stable attached to the Trapper Cabin.  We thought it might be one of the other boys looking for a place to go to the bathroom.  When we got up, we looked out and saw nothing, so we checked the fire.  Sure enough there were several big prints in the soft earth about 5 feet from the fire.  We tried to tell our Boy Scout leader what we found, but he laughed and said he had been over there.  We asked when, he said about an hour AFTER we went to bed and AFTER when we had seen the shadow.  His prints were closer to the tent than the prints of the shadow.  That was in the Spring of 1966. My next encounter came in 1970.  I was working for the Forest Service as a lookout on Mount Emily, just outside Brookings Oregon.  You can look up at Mount Emily from Brookings. It was only about 10 miles in a straight line, as the crow flies, but by road, it is about 60 miles.  I had a black lab I called Bucky.  He lived with me on the tower.  This was a 25 foot tower from the ground to the catwalk.  One evening in July, I had to go down the mountain because I had a Doctor appointment and I needed to get some groceries.  I locked Bucky on the tower with the intention of being back on the mountain early the next morning.  Buck did not like being alone, and he apparently jumped OFF the tower.  When I got back the next morning, Bucky was gone.  I called and called, looking for his tracks but I found nothing.  It got lonely up there for the next two weeks.  I presumed Buck was badly injured in his jump and had crawled off somewhere and died.  I gave up hope.  About 10 days later, I heard a noise in the late evening sunset down off the hill I was on, and sure enough I saw Bucky.  He was very tired and worn out.  He was panting so hard I thought he was gonna die.  I carried him up the tower and into the chart room and laid him on the bed.  After about an hour he got up and went to drink.  He drank three full bowls of water before he was done.  He crawled back up on the bed and went to sleep.  Now, Buck never and I mean NEVER barked or growled.  He just did not.  He was so mild and good natured he just did not carry on like most dogs.  That is why he was such a great companion. After that incident, he NEVER left my side.  He stuck to me like glue.  He did not want to be left alone.  If I had to go to the outhouse, he would sit outside the door and whine until I was done.  He was scared, very scared.  He took to sleeping UNDER my bunk.  He never did that before. He would also take to barking in the early and late evenings.  He would stand there on the catwalk looking down at the mountain to the Southwest and bark and bark and bark.  He had never done that before either.  About 2 weeks later, in the early evening, I was scanning the woods with my binoculars when I heard a ripping, tearing sound.  The kind of sound a dead tree makes.  It was not a widow maker falling because it was not a thump.  It sounded more like the sound you would hear ripping up a dead rotting tree.  I knew it was not a bear opening up a dead tree looking for grubs, because there are NO BEARS on that mountain.  The Indians used to bury their dead up there and called it the mountain of the GODS because it seemed to be always enshrouded in fog or clouds.  In fact, the only animals I ever saw up there in the two years I spent on the mountain as a look out were a few rats, a couple of chipmunks and me.  Occasionally I would have a human visitor but most  of the time, I was totally and completely alone.  I went down the tower and walked in the direction of the sound.  I searched for quite some time, while Bucky stayed on the tower and barked.  He was really frightened.  I had my rifle with me, but I never found where the sound came from, nor did I see any sign of what made the sound. Several days later, late in the evening, about 10:30 or so, we were both trying to sleep.  The full moon was setting on the horizon and the whole tower was lit up.  It was very warm, the temperature had been in the high 90's for several days.  I opened the windows to let whatever breeze there was flow through the windows and out the door.  As I laid on the bunk, there was a huge boom; and the whole tower Shook. It felt like a car had run into the tower or perhaps a sonic boom.  But the tower shook FIRST.  Something had hit the tower.  My first reaction was to grab my gun, because several of the other lookouts in the district around Grants Pass and Cave Junction had been getting potshots by environmentalists and pot growers.  Word and been quietly spread by forest service officials that while it was NOT an official order, we could if we were so inclined, arm ourselves for protection.  Since we were so far out in the boonies, it would take hours for anyone to come to our aid, even if we did call in by radio for help. I crawled out the window to the catwalk and belly crawled around the tower looking to see if anyone might be down below. Bucky was under the bed with every hair on his body standing straight up and growling so deep in his throat, I thought he was going to bleed.  I have never in my life had seen an animal so scared.  He actually evacuated poop, and urine right there on the floor under the bed.  His eyes were actually drained of all color, much like those of a husky.  The iris was actually white.  He was scared to death.  It took me hours to coax him from under the bed, and he hardly recognized me.  I remember I had NOT seen any car lights approaching the mountain, and since the last 2 miles of the road could only be traveled by foot, four wheel drive or mountain bike, I knew that few, if anybody, would be nuts enough to make that climb in the dark, let alone during daylight.  Those boulders were big enough to rip wheels off, or oil pans out of a vehicle unless great care and skill were used to get up that road during the day, let alone at night.  Whatever it was had slammed the tower and disappeared.   Now, let me say this: the lookout tower, which is gone now, stood at the top of the mountain and had a good 360 degree view of the ranger district in all directions.  As you look due West, the mountain goes out about 50 - 60 yards and begins to drop off to the Chetco river below.  To the North and a bit east, there is a sheer drop off to where Anaconda Mining used to have their mine site.  To the Southwest the mountain slopes off and down and is covered not only by large river rock or perhaps tailings, but also by dense, thick hairy manzanita.  This stuff will rip the clothes off your back in nothing flat.  The only way to get through it is with a bulldozer or what we used to call tin Pants, heavy canvas clothing.  To the East is the road up the mountain and more thick underbrush.  The sparsely located trees on this mountain were, at that time, not much over 16 - 18 feet tall.  The brush, manzanita, was anywhere from 2 - 6 foot high, and very densely packed. The rocks covering the site of the tower ranged from a few centimeters to up to 10 inches long.  They were from a few inches to about 8 or 9 inches thick.  In other words these rocks were not 5 or 6 foot in diameter boulders.  When I went down the tower the next morning about 6:45 to get water, I checked the Southwest leg of the tower, where the slamming had come from.  The only tracks; I found were not tracks per se as you would find in dirt or mud. Rather they were imprints of something big shoving off, like the type you find in gravel.  What ever it was, it had hit the tower, with its arms, hands, body...but no implements like a log, or a rock, since there were no indents in the wooded leg of the tower.  Then after slamming the tower, it had shoved off in hast to depart the area.  AND .... IT had gone off the southwest side of the mountain through the densest part of the Hairy Manzanita.  I remember looking for any kind of evidence that a human might have left but saw nothing, not even hair or other bits of debris.  It was spooky, like a ghost had attacked and left. My experiences with bigfoot were put on hold for several years after that since I went to college and joined the Army in 1971.  It was not until I got out of the Army in 1977 and returned to Oregon that my destiny seemed to bring bigfoot back into my life.  I had forgotten all about bigfoot by this time.  Oh sure, I remembered the incident(s); as I called them, but they were not something I dwelled on. Its now deer hunting  season, 1978.  I am living in Klamath Falls, and decide to go hunting to put meat on the table.  I drove to the base of Mt. McLoughlin, (Mt. Pitt) parked at the trailhead, got my weapon and my gear and started up the slope.  Several hundred yards up the hill there is a saddle the trail goes through as you head in a southwesterly direction.  Off to the right is a small pond or lake.  Being behind the mountain away from the sun, it was sort of dark, more like twilight.  I stood at the edge of the lake wondering if there were any fish in it.  I looked around and realized I was in sort of bowl shaped area.  Off to my left was what appeared to be a dead-burned out snag about 8 or 10 feet tall.  It was all black and just There.  Across the lake from me, the embankment rose up about 10 feet with slick leaf brush all over it.  I tried to figure out how to get around this obsticle without making too much noise and headed off to go up the hillside to find a stand.  I figured the deer might head this way to get to water and perhaps I might get a shot.  After about 15 minutes, I began to realize that daylight was going fast and I could not see well enough.  So I gave up and headed back to the car and try it again another day. A bit earlier next time.  As I approached the lake I thought I heard something and stopped to see if there were any deer lurking about.  That is when I noticed that the dead-burned out snag that HAD been standing up the little embankment on the south side of the lake was now GONE!  I got a good case of the heeby-jeebys and fled the area.  I thought about it later and discussed this with a friend of mine.  He suggested I had seen a bigfoot.  I said he was nuts.  Big foot lives in the Siskiyous, not the Cascades.  He laughed and told me I was an ignorant bas----.  He said bigfoot lives all over the mountains in Oregon and was not just confined to one or two areas. I thought about that and it made sense. A few days later, this guy and I both decided to go hunting up near Cherry Peak, to the North of Mt. Pitt.  We hunted all over the top of Cherry Peak, especially in the saddle between the peak and a ridge to the West.  We found a herd of Elk about half way down a valley that becomes a draw, and we hunted to the head waters of Cherry Creek.  We only saw the Elk, but no deer and NOTHING ELSE!  We drove back down Cherry Peak road, up the main highway toward Ft. Klamath, till we got to Cherry Creek road.  We drove up this road as far as we could.  It was getting dark by then so we turned around and decided to stop and relieve ourselves.  While we were standing there enjoying the evening, I felt we were being watched.  He looked up at me suddenly, and his eyes asked the same thing I was feeling.  Do you feel that?  We both turned around and began scanning the underbrush close by the road where we were parked.  I did a dumb thing, but it was the only way to resolve this feeling.  I took my .44 out of its holster and fired a round into the creek bout 20 yards up the road.  Within 10 seconds the sound of the blast died away, as did the feeling we were being watched.  We both realized the hair on our necks were standing up and our skin was crawling.  We did NOT have the same reaction to the Elk.  Nor did we ever have that same reaction to other animals in the woods.  We both looked at each other, knew what the other was thinking....BIG FOOT!  We quickly and quietly got back in the car and got out of Dodge.   In 1983 while at the doctor's office one day for an upper respiratory infection and while my wife got her pregnancy checked, I spied an OLD Indian.  I waited a few minutes, and when my curiosity got the better of me, I said excuse me, are you of the Klamath Tribe.  He looked at me and said yes.  I then explained my curiosity about big foot.  He smiled and said, oh yes, there is such an animal and it lives all over the area.  I said are you sure? It is being so elusive and all...  He said he had seen bigfoot several times and began going on about how the Indian believes it is a spirit and such.  He then told me a story, about a big foot that allegedly lives up near Scott Mountain, or Mt Scott.  He said he and his father, brothers, and uncles were in that area hunting and on a vision quest; one time when he was younger.  This old gentleman said that one evening while they were all sitting around a BIG campfire talking, that a doe suddenly came running, not bounding, or bouncing, but RUNNING THROUGH the camp fire.  It was running to get away from something.  That it was something; was about 3 yards behind the doe and swinging a big club trying to KILL the deer.  This gentle old Indian man said that the sight came as such a surprise that all the men went over backwards on the logs they were sitting on, as this bigfoot came hard charging after the deer, right through the fire, swinging this club at the deer, totally ignoring the Indians sitting there. He kinda laughed and said it is true.  He left then as his turn came to go in to see the doctor.  He also left me with many unanswered questions. Over the years since then, I have found out that I can sense the presence of many types of animals while I am out in the woods.  I can sense when a man is near, a deer, an elk, a bear....and a big foot. Now, while this may seem like fiction or a flight of fancy, let me assure you that after nearly 40 years in the radio and television news industry, I have never sought to have myself noticed.  Just being on the microphone does that enough.  I do not go around talking about these incidents unless the person I am speaking with has either brought up the issue, or the subject has come up WITHOUT me starting the conversation.  As a newsman, I MUST deal in facts to maintain any credibility for the news I report on to be truth.  I MUST deal in truth. True, some of these incidents happened a long time ago, but the reality of these incidents is as clear as though it happened yesterday.  They were so unusual, so out of the ordinary, that it would be hard to make up this kind of story.  I have heard many others speak of these beings in events which happened on farms and ranches, or to hunters in the mountains and wilderness of the southern Oregon and northern California areas.  They are so numerous and cover such a time span that one would be hard pressed to ignore the evidence from these people's lips or the fact that these events DID happen.  Do I believe in bigfoot....HELL YES!  Do I understand what they are or where they came from, NOT HARDLY!.  All I and many others who have lived here all our lives KNOW is that they are there, they are not necessarily violent, nor are they a danger to anyone but the occasional odd deer or other wildlife they chase or hunt for food.  Are they ignorant?  To our way of life yes, but to their way of living they are very intelligent and they do survive.\", \"location_details\": \"Lower elevation area lakes and valleys near Mount McLoughlin\", \"county\": \"Jackson County\", \"state\": \"Oregon\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 3820: Sasquatch evidence near Mount McLoughlin\", \"latitude\": 42.4356, \"longitude\": -122.2328, \"date\": \"1979-10-01\", \"number\": 3820.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9r916t0v33\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.2328 42.4356)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My hunting partner Ed and I were into the second week of the Oregon bow season.

I went left Ed went to the right. I hadn\\u2019t gone far when I came to a depression in the muddy gravely pond edge. It looked like a very big heavy person had left a footprint there. I got down and saw that there were toe impressions at the front. Well I called Ed over to see this and he said there was another one behind the first. We backtracked the prints and found what appeared to be skid marks on the hill side of the pond. This was just next to the small trickle of water which fed the pond. The hair on the back of my neck stood right up. We went up the hill for about forty yards but found indistinguishable impressions in the trashy undergrowth. We went back down and tracked them in the other direction and the impressions (overturned pebbles, broken and bent grasses) went about 100 yards down a hill into a ravine thick with manzineta and small scrub oak. We then went back to the foot tracks and covered them with logs so they wouldn\\u2019t be destroyed. Went home and got some plaster of Paris. We made the impressions and we were shocked to find that there were definitely toes on one cast the other was in too much gravel to make a good impression. At the same time I took some pictures of Ed stretching to match the stride of the prints. The next week we went into the same area, same skid road, about 300 yards past the stock tank. We were walking side by side when something to my left and slightly behind us, up the hill aprox.100yards something caught my eye. I spun around to see what it was, and to my astonishment I saw a pair of legs running into the thick underbrush. I couldn\\u2019t see all of it because of the trees. My impression was of a two legged creature, animal,  with long brown hair on the legs running away from us. Ed saw the branches swinging back into place but saw nothing else. We both got spooked and quickly went back to the truck and never hunted there again. I gave the plaster cast to my nephew in San Jose California and have never seen them again. I still have the photos of Ed stretching to match the stride. The foot prints measured 18\\\" long By 6\\\" across the heel, and 8\\\" across the ball of the foot.

I was driving along on the Prospect/Butte Falls highway. I came around a corner and was slowed down to about 30 mph. As we turned the corner, about 40 yards down the road on the right hand side, I saw what I thought was a man take a step from the road into the forest. I clearly saw an arm swing and a leg. What struck me strange was that he was pitch black from head to toe. I said to my wife, \\\"What was that?\\\" She said, \\\"I don't know.\\\" At this point I am still thinking that it was a person, but that it was strange. There was a dirt logging road that crossed the highway right where the creature was standing. I started slowing down and expected to see a person, or a truck or camper on the road. As we went by and looked, there was nothing there. We continued down the road and my wife and I talked about what we had seen. My daughter was in the back seat of the truck and did not see anything. I all happened very quickly. I did not see anything until it moved as I was proocuppied by driving and towing. My wife saw it standing there by the road before it moved and clearly saw hair and could see both sides of the torso. I kept running over in my mind what it might have been. I have lived in this area all of my life and have seen every animal that lives in the woods. This did not fit in any catagory. The only thing that color is a black bear, and this clearly was not a bear. We finally agreed that it may have been a bigfoot. We decided to hurry to out camp and drop the trailer and get back down and look for tracks. I had my camera and my intention was to find some tracks and get some pictures of them. We went to camp and hurried back to the spot. The time since we went by was about an hour. The logging road turned out to be very dry and hard. I searched all around in the forest and on the other side of the highway for tracks, but could not find anything that was clearly a bigfoot track. I went back to were it was standing an stood in the same spot and was looking up in the tree standing there looking for a bees nest or something that perhaps a bear might be interested in. I was still trying to eliminate all other possibilities. Then it occured to me that when I had seen this creature step off of the road that it had stepped behind some branches on this tree.

My friends were staying at the resort cabins at one of my favorite fall fishing lakes. By the time we arrived (delayed by wiring problems on my boat trailer) it was about 3 a.m.  We talked untill there was little reason to go to bed, just to have to get right back up to catch the morning bite. About an hour-and-a-half before sunrise my friend Wes and I decided to go for a little walk down to one of the streams that feed out of the lake.  I was curious to see what the fish were doing. We both had flashlights, shining them into the stream as we walked along trying to spot fish. The further we went, the more uneasy I became and I have been in these woods all of my life and never felt like this ever. I asked Wes if he felt kind of weird he said, \\\"Kind of.\\\"  We decided we'd head back. We moved to a different cabin closer to the lake. After the evening fish I returned at late light, bummed about missing a very large brown trout.  I spent most of the evening listening to fish jump and looking at stars. Wes' mom went to bed first and about 11:45p.m the rest of us went to bed. My girlfriend and I were not sleeping in the cabin with Wes and his family. We were sleeping in the back of a full size Chevy Surburban, mainly because Angela and I wanted a little privancy.  Angela and didn't go right to sleep. This was about an hour-and-a-half after everyone said good night at the camp fire. I sat up to smoke a cigarette and I was looking out the rear side window when something caught my eye. The cabins where we were staying are not very large. There was outdoor lighting attached to the middle of the roof line of the cabin. At first I thought it was the wind moving the tree branches or bushes but something wasn't right.  I then began to realize was I was seeing. I thought maybe I was a little more tired than I thought and that my eyes were playing tricks on me. Except the trick didn't go away. Just to make sure, I asked Angela to sit up and look around and tell me what she sees. I totally expected to look stupid and have her tell me she saw nothing. I did not tell her what I was seeing or where I was seeing it.  I looked down at the floor. Angela sat up and it wasn't even two seconds before she visually locked onto the same thing I did. Still looking at the floor, I asked, \\\" What do you see.\\\" Her first word was, \\\"Yeti,\\\" and with that things now felt real.   We both became excited, scared, and curious.  I was a bit more uneasy with how the bigfoot was moving and acting. It was about 50 feet away back in the tree line on the other side of the cabin, about 15 feet away from Wes' mom's truck. It was standing just out of the light, so as not be directly seen. It was about 7-1/2 to 8 feet tall, covered in hair,  very broad in the shoulder and across the chest.  It wasn't as bulky as what is in the Patterson film.  What made me very uneasy was its movements and actions. It wasn't coming forward. It had one arm up above its head and to the side, resting on a tree.  It was rapidly rocking from side to side, and bobbing up and down. Angela made a statement about getting out to maybe get closer to it.  I was in the process of telling her, \\\"No!\\\"  when the next surprise was realized. Anglea points out that there's more than one. About two feet behind the tailgate of my friend's moms truck, was crouched not one, but two of what appeared to be smaller bigfoots. They were crouched close together, sitting motionless and looking directly at us. They looked like they were younger ones, compared to the big one still rocking back and forth by the tree. They were not as broad in the shoulders or chest. Angela and I wondered what to do, quietly talking to each other for five or ten minutes. I decided to wake up Wes by yelling toward the window of his bedroom, which was in the middle of the back wall of the cabin. Wes answered back and I told him to look out his window.  At first he couldn't see anything through the window. I didn't tell him what to look for or what I was seeing for fear of him thinking we were pulling a joke or that we were totally out of  our minds. As he opened the window, I asked him, \\\"Do you see it?\\\" His response was, \\\"Oh, my #%&^@ God!\\\" Wes didn't say another word, which made me even more uneasy. I couldn't deal with it anymore.  I jumped up to the front seat and was gonna start up the rig to back them off a little.  When I got up front, I couldn't find the keys. I became a bit panicky. I found the keys and started up the Chevy with a big \\\"vrooom!\\\" and it hardly seem to bother them. I then decided if I was going to see Bigfoot, then by god, I'm gonna try to get a good look!! I was parked in such a way that I had to pull way out and swing the front end around for my lights to hit them directly.  As soon as the Chevy moved, they took off back into the trees and bushes. I then headed down the road toward a picnic aera where they might cross the road. On the way, Angela said she had enough and didn't want to be around the bigfoot anymore. I turned around, ended up taking a wrong turn finding, and myself driving cross country through the cabins and the resort. I was turned around so badly I didn't know where I was.  Angela spotted the cabin where we stayed the first night. I then began to drive out to the highway to leave because Angela didn't want to return until daylight. Just before I got to the highway, I remembered my friends at the cabin and the fact that they had their newborn baby with them.  Angela agreed we couldn't leave them there, so we returned.  Wes said that as we were driving off, something ran across the road behind us on two legs. Angela and I decided to leave the Chevy parked halfway blocking the road and go inside the cabin.  After we got inside, I asked Wes if he'd seen what we saw, because I still could not take in the fact that this really happened. Wes told me he definitely saw what he belives to be a bigfoot. he explained that he became silient because of the two smaller ones at the back of his mom's truck. After twenty minutes had gone by, I needed a smoke real bad and Wes' mom wanted something to drink. Both were in my rig.  Wes was the first to step out side. On the way back to the cabin,  we heard a bunch of comotion down toward the lake, like something running through bushes, snapping and breaking limbs. We ran to the front door of the cabin.

Things were quiet outside from then on, other than the fact that a raccoon thumped on our door, which startled us.  What was strange was that the raccoon seem to want to come into the cabin.

It was a fall evening, I was doing homework at our trailer, which was 1/2 mile from where my dad was building our house. He would get home from work around 4:00 and work out there till 10. One evening he came flying out the road in his truck and pulled in the driveway, then ran to the trailer asking my mom for the tape recorder. I was curious and asked him what was going on, he said that there was something in the valley fighting with a dog. So I grabbed my coat and wanted to go see, he let me go with him, but told me to stay in the truck, I didn't listen and tried to follow him. So he told me to stand by the cows feed trough, which was near the house at top of field. He grabbed a wooden club and put the tape recorder in his shirt pocket and started walking down the hill towards the noise. I remember that when this creature growled, it shook the ground where I was standing, about 200 yards away. I was scared, and even more scared for my dad, who was now about half way to it. Another weird thing was that the 6 head of cattle we had were standing head to head in a circle at the edge of the woods. It took my dad about 5 minutes to get to the woods, where this creature was fighting a dog, you can hear the leaves crunching under every step he took. But when he got nearer it was too dark in the wooded valley for him to see the creature. So he returned back up the hill. The entire time that the recorder was on, you can hear this earth moving growl along with a dog fighting with it. Oddly, our neighbors dog (HENRY), who came around a lot, was never seen or heard from again. My dad wouldn't let me go near that valley for a while, but eventually I was allowed to go down there.  And when I did, I looked around the area I heard the battle, and found a bunch of deer hair and bones scattered around a 20 foot area, But no (HENRY). Back when this happened I was about 8-10 years old, and didn't think of looking for hair samples or DNA, or even footprints. Looking back, I wish I would have thought of all that stuff. But I do still have the tape recording, I really want someone from the BFRO to take this tape and get it transferred to digital. Everyone of our neighbors listened to this tape, and no one can say what it is for sure.

Onebody near our site for atleast a quarter mile or more. Kat(my daughter) fell asleep and the two of us sat up and chatted. Off behind the tent, about 100 yards maybe closer, I heard a thud like a stick smacking a tree. Our yorkshire terrir heard it too. Then it was louder, more distinct like a base ball bat hitting a tree. My girlfriend was nervous, I could tell. I told her I had heard such a noise on a tape of Big Foot. She didn't like that I said that and got alittle scared. I told her it would be ok and that whatever or whoever would not come near the firelight. She still was uneasy. We heard it for about 15 miinutes as it got further away from us.I thought I heard a weird howling too but I just chalked it up as a coyote or wolf. Though I have heard big foot howls and this did sound similar. I still wasn't sure. All in all I figured it was telling us that this was his place and that we should not be here. I had to lie to my girlfriend so she could sleep and said it was most likely a skunk or racoon. Though I know niether of those could hit a tree like that. The next morning, I decided to look around and went out into the forest about 75 yards or more from the camp. I could still see the tent through the trees. I found afew old logs broken over.A few trees in the distance looked bent over as if someone had done it by hand(typical sign of big foot markings) but I never told my girlfriend. We stayed another night there but we had very noisy campers about 80 yards up the road trying to fight with another camper about the noise they were making. This was last year. Now, I went on google earth and was looking at The Kinzua Dam In Warren Pa. I noticed an orange dot near the dam just passed it to the east I believe. I clicked on it and it said 1999-10-?? I tried the link and WHOAH!! was I excited... A big foot sighting right there!!! I loved it. I am thinking on going back to the same place to camp this summer.

There was a trail that was used by kids in the area to get down into the woods and a little way off the trail, my brother and I had hauled a little wood and built a little platform about six feet up in the crook of a tree. That day, around noon, we were in that platform, shooting our BB gun at a tall stump that was just a little ways down hill from where we were. My brother turned around as I was preparing to fire and just as I was ready to shoot the BB gun, something with a human-like head passed right in front of the tall stump. The trees and brush obscured everything but the head, but I got a good look at it. It had brown fur over almost all of the head, but not dark brown, just a little darker than cinnamon color, a kind of flat nose and the hair/fur was not too long. It walked by and disappeared into the brush almost without making a sound (there was a very heavy bed of needles from the Douglas Fir all over), it happened so suddenly and so fast that I didn't have a chance to get scared. I called my brother's name and he turned in time to see some of the branches still swaying. We stood there and talked about it for a few minutes and then carefully went down to where it passed in front of me and figured that it had to have been about 7 1/2 feet tall. After this, I went to my former eighth grade science teacher who happened to live in the neighborhood (this was a town of about 1,200 at the time) and told him about it. He was very skeptical and gave me numerous things that he thought I'd seen. He obviously didn't believe I had seen a Sasquatch/Bigfoot. Later that same day, around dusk, my brother and I were sitting on the trail, not too far from the \\\"tree fort\\\" that I had seen it from earlier in the day, talking about it. Suddenly, I'm not sure what made him do it, but he looked over at the platform that we had built (about 20 to 30 yards away) and his face turned white as a ghost. I looked over there and saw a sillouette of a\\\"man\\\" looking at us (head and shoulders) from behind our tree fort. Since it was dusk, we weren't able to make out any features, just the outline. Also, we both jumped up and ran the rest of the way home, scared half out of our wits. The second sighting we had that day, the creature didn't seem anything but curious about us, but it still scared us. Also, two years later, I was down in the woods at almost midnight (I'd left something down there the previous day) and heard footsteps coming towards me and a huffing noise, almost like a horse blowing.

And from the hike earlier in day I noticed a large pile of boulders near the top of the ridge. It sounded like something was hunting for something. I sat up in my tent 100% alert. I wasn't dreaming. I tried to wake up my friends, but was frozen stiff. I was surprised no one else woke up. Finally I was asleep, only to be awakened to footsteps outside our camp. It didn't sound like a bear, because the foot steps were spaced apart longer than a four legged animal. I could not talk, so I tried to throw my socks at my friends. Nothing at all. I forced myself to sleep and the next day I only asked if anyone else woke up last night to any loud noises. No one did, so I never mentioned the rocks, and footsteps.

We were on the outskirts of camp, maybe half mile from main camp, very close to the molalla river.  I was about 60 feet from a muddy creek, kind of a swampy area. I remember sitting down to eat lunch and my friend realized that he had left something back at camp that he needed.  I can't remember what he went to get, maybe a tool or something to drink.  So he left and I remained seated on a log waiting for him to come back.  I expected the jog to take maybe ten minutes.  He had been gone for at least seven minutes when I heard something in the woods to my left.  I stood up to get a better look at what it was.  What I observed was a massive hairy man-like animal standing next to a large tree (I think it was a cedar). It was about 50 feet away.  I estimate that it was about 8 ft tall.  I stood about 5 ft 9 in. at that time and it was far taller than me.  It was also very wide and bulky looking.  The fur was thick and fairly long, maybe 6 inches, and medium brown in color. It looked directly at me for a few seconds.  We had solid eye contact.  It had dark colored eyes.  It seemed to be shocked or surprised and was deciding what to do.  It stepped to it's right, my left, behind the large tree and immediately began to run away.  I could not see it run away because the tree blocked my view, but I definately heard it.  It sounded very heavy, the footsteps could be heard cleary.  It was snapping down branches as it ran, creating a lot of noise.  It sounded very powerful.

I hope you don't take my report as bogus because of that. Let me explain my situation to you: I live, and have lived, on the Molalla river for most of my life and never thought twice about walking around at night or anywhere period. About 2 months ago, I was alone in my Grandmas house using the computer, when I decided to go home (my house is only about 50 yards away). As I was stepping outside the most hideous feeling of being alone and fear thumped my heart. I kept walking in terror, when all of the sudden about 30 feet off to my right, I heard a loud thumping sound crash out. From there on, being distorted by my act of running faster than I've ever moved before, I could swear I heard the distinctive two-legged footsteps veering toward me from off the trail between houses. I raced in my house, slammed the door, locked it and sat in the living room to calm down from my strange experience.The oddest feelings flushed through me then, and now. Now, before you dismiss my story as a frightened child running from noises, I'll have to tell you of the strange past our 45 acres of land at the end of the Dickey Prairie road has had: Around three years ago, when we had cattle and cows fenced on our property, I noticed casually how they would always stay together and go near the barns at night. Then one day we discovered two of them killed up in the woods by the drinking creek. The killings weren't average killings either. The cows didn't have a scratch on them, both had broken necks and their eyeballs sucked cleanly out. Since those experiences, I'm now scared to go hiking and travel at night. Yes, average signs of fear, but I have the weird feeling of being an 'Intruder'. Thank you for your time sincerely, Shawn Murray p.s.

I am mainly putting it on here because I have thought about it in depth (that's why the delay in reporting), and the only thing in my memory that has any resemblance at all to what I've heard is the past audio recordings of bigfoot (although what I heard had better audio!).  I still wonder if this was a bigfoot, how or why it would have been near a town, but I have no other explanations. I was in Sandy, Oregon with my family during the weekend of July 21-23, 2000. We were staying at the Sandy Inn, which is just west of the main part of town.  It was hard to sleep the night of the 21st; it was very humid and some thunderstorms did move through about midnight or so.  I was up several times during the night; either to shut the window, open the window, turn on the air conditioning, etc.  I got up once around 3 or so in the morning on the 22nd after the storms passed. I was sticking my head out of our 2nd story window, enjoying some cool air and kind of looking off into the woods toward the north.  There was not a sound anywhere (that I could hear). No cars on the highway, nothing.  Then I heard a very indescribable sound. I thought at first it was tires screeching but as the seconds passed I realized a car would have to be burning rubber for a long ways. Then as I kinda cleared my head, I thought it sounded like a man screaming, or better yet, wailing.  But I've n ever heard a human do a sound like that either. It was not a moan or howling with an \\\"o\\\" sound, it was more like \\\"eye-eeee--ah-eye-eee\\\". Very high pitched. It won't do me much good to try to interpret the sound in letters.  But the way the pitch of the sound went up and down so fast, I've never heard any animal or human do that, and I've heard quite a lot of animals.  If a a human did what I heard, they'd bust their vocal chords. It went on for about 20 seconds-maybe a little longer, but not sure of that. It did seem to kind of trail off at one point then come back. I know it was long enough for me to get a good listen.  It was not close by, either. The window faced toward the north, so it's possible that's where it came from but I can't be sure of that. It seemed like it was off in the distance somewhere. When it started, it was rather quiet, and ended trailing off in the same manner it started.  Even though I was a bit groggy, it was wierd enough to wake me up and even scare me a bit.  I didn't think too much of it at the time but the next morning I was thinking to myself, \\\"What was that?\\\"  I didn't report it or consider that until now because I wasn't sure and after a while I honestly had forgotten about it until something in my mind triggered it again.

It was around midnight when I noticed strange noises in the treeline approx. 100 yards from his house. These noises were birdlike in nature and seemed to be coming from 3 places, directly in front of the house and off to both sides and further away. These noises sounded like birds but were only part of a bird call, and they seemed to be answering each other. There were 5 different noises and while they seemed birdlike they definitely came from something larger than a bird. At approx. 12:30 am I finally asked the other people at the house to come outside and listen. Everyone agreed that the noises were strange and like nothing they had ever heard before. We shined a flashlight in the area that noises seemed closest and saw nothing due to heavy brush, but the noises quit in that area until we stopped shining the light. These noises lasted until approx. a half an hour until dawn and quit quite suddenly. I grew up in the area and spend alot of time hunting and fishing and being in the outdoors, as does the property owner, we could not identify any local animal that makes these noises. In the morning we went and looked in the area closest to the house and found want could 2 possible tracks, they matched nothing we had ever seen, and we compared them with the other animal tracks in the area and they matched nothing, also noticed that the grass was pushed down in approx 3-4 foot strides running through the field behind the stream area where we found the possible tracks and where we thought some the noises were coming from.

Unfortunately, when we got to our destination, I was the only one in our group that wanted to look for Bigfoot. Disappointed but not dissuaded, I tried to keep the rest of the group (2 guys and 1 girl) at least somewhat interested in the Bigfoot search, to little avail. The first night we camped (under much protest) quite a way into the bush and away from the overcrowded camp grounds where everyone felt more comfortable.  We followed an old logging road until it ended at a very secluded spot atop a ridge and maybe 250 to 350 yards directly south of the clear cut power line running east/west. The first night was interesting as we continued to hear distinct wood knocking; they started at around 11:00pm. Most were far off and very fast, 4 to 7 quick, sharp cracks directly east of us that would echo across the valley only to be answered from another direction farther south and then north but at first they were pretty far off. Everyone thought they were gunshots but this was a really dark night and these sounds were coming from pretty deep in the thick forest accessed only by not well traveled logging roads and from at least 3 different sources that for the life of me, sounded like they were communicating so I ruled out gunshots. These sounds continued to get closer to our campsite as the night wore on. At one point, maybe 12:30 or 1:00am the group wanted to drive over to the power lines, where the trees weren\\u2019t so thick and you could see for several miles, I decided to stay at camp and hope for something to happen. Almost immediately after everyone left, I started hearing sticks breaking from the direction they had driven out on and everything got real quiet. Now I\\u2019m from Montana and have spent many a night camped alone in far more rugged mountains than I was in now and have experienced most of the wildlife at least partially up close and personal that our American forests have to offer but I gotta tell you, I got a little spooked while they were gone! I did what any self respecting outdoors man would do and\\u2026put a lot more wood on the fire! I didn\\u2019t hear anything at that time that sounded too bizarre but I was glad when everyone got back. My buddy asked me if I was knocking rocks together while they were gone. I told him I hadn\\u2019t and asked what they heard. He said that they were out looking at the valley from the top of the road we came in on, about 250 to 350yards away and they all heard distinct knocking coming from the direction of our camp, he said it sounded like rock on rock. Later after everyone had gone to their tents I again decided to stay up. At around 3:30am I heard a very low grumble with a huff followed by what sounded like a lot of breath being pushed out and very close to the fire, maybe 30ft. At first I thought it was a bird or something, then, almost immediately another answered the first from across the clearing we were camped in directly behind me. I put my flashlight on where I heard the sound coming from and it would stop. 10 min later it would start up again. I don\\u2019t know why I didn\\u2019t get anyone up to listen with me but I didn\\u2019t. This went on for about an hour, until the sun started to brighten the sky and you could see a lot better. I never heard walking or anymore sticks breaking but those grunting noises were definitely close and there was at least 2 of whatever was making them. It wasn\\u2019t until on our way home that my buddy told me that he had heard the grunts too and, I love this, he was too scared to get up and investigate. The next day we went looking for another campground. I didn\\u2019t want to leave but I was definitely the minority on the subject. As we were driving down, I believe was FR43, my buddy and I in his rig and his friends behind us in theirs, something very big ran across the road about 150yrds in front of us. It was dark brown or black and uniform in color and at least 8ft to 9ft tall and moving like a freight train, it was huge! We only saw it for maybe a second before it tore into the trees running from the right to the left. My skeptical buddy looked at me and said \\u201cDid you see that!\\u201d I had my video camera in my lap but there was no way I could have gotten a shot of this thing, it was really moving! We stopped where we thought it crossed the road and you could see quite clearly where something had came down the incline on the right side of the road, we didn't smell anything. We got out and I climbed the small incline that it had come down to investigate and after 30 min or so found a barefoot track 18\\u201d long x 7\\u00bd\\u201d wide and got video of it. I can send you the video and have other stories of the area as well. We did have material to cast the print but since it was in the mossy ground that covers most of the Oregon forest my buddy refused to cast the print claiming that we wouldn\\u2019t get anything from it.

Now I KNOW,..... August 25, 2009 my girlfriend, her two boys and I went camping at my usual spot. This location was picked due to the isolation factor; it's 10 miles up logging roads near Estacada, Oregon. I will not disclose the GPS cords. or even close to prox., This is MY spot. Nothing abnormal occured over the day or night of the 24th, and the day of the 25th was normal events like gathering wood for the coming night. We had put the boys down for the night just after sun down. We were hanging around the fire chatting and poking the fire. Being who I am, I began making noise to hear it echo through the trees. You know, rooster noises and some whooping, basic idiot noises (approx. 1130 pm). I do this at times to keep bigger game from coming through camp. Well, I got one hell of a shock about 15 minutes later. We were walking back toward the fire from the truck, the fire was only bright glowing coals at this point, and BOOM, shock to the system!!!! Out of the pitch black night....one of the most unreal sounds I've ever heard in my life came rushing through the dark. It was a hair stiffening scream that at that moment I couldn't match in my memory of noises over the 20 years I've been going into nature to escape. This was the first time in my life that I felt a need to get out of nature, QUICKLY. The sound pushed through the trees like the trees were not even there. Even the air around us seemed to vibrate. From experience I have had in the woods through my life, and tracking sounds and distance, I'm estimating that this scream was being produced about 200 yards away. It was so loud that nothing I know of could make this big of a noise. There is no animal I have come accross that has the lungs to produce such a loud, long and vocalized sound as this \\\"creature\\\" produced. Let me put it this way....if someone told me they heard it, I would be trying to put a K9 responsible, but hearing it myself and knowing of nothing I've ever encountered could make that sound. Now, I did not stand there much longer. I think I may have pushed my girlfriend up into the truck so I could get in ASAP. As soon as I was in, the lights were on and the horn going for about 3 seconds to try to keep it from getting closer. It seemed to work because the volume started to fade a bit. We decided to get camp up and get out. over the minutes it took us to completely tear down camp, maintain a track on movement of the screams and shove camp into the truck, the screamig continued and moved. From the time it started ,it was at 2 o'clock from the camp. While we were packing up, it moved clockwise around to about 5 o'clock from camp.  This all took about 30 minutes before we were on our way down hill. The screams continued even on our way out. To make it completely clear, I've done alot in my life. Anything from solo hunting at the age of 12 and up to my time in the military, Iv'e never been spooked even with rounds wizzing past.....BUT that scared me to the point of every hair from the top of my toes to the top of my head were at attention!

With numerous rock quarries used to create the logging roads, at times the shooters make the canyons sound like a war zone. But as soon as playtime is over and evening sets in, people head back down the hill and the war zone transforms into a more serene and mysterious place. Booms and blasts are replaced with the sounds of the wind blowing through the firs, birds chirping and camp conversations. When night falls, another reality becomes quickly apparent. This area has one of the highest instances of Sasquatch encounters in the country. Like many, I have reviewed lots of evidence online and from word of mouth, all the while wrestling with a degree of skepticism. This was not my first experience with this group leader, but it would prove to be my most memorable to date. We arrived at camp somewhere in the 2:30 to 3:00 PM range, set-up and planned for that night\\u2019s scouting. As the sun set and dusk turned to dark, the group leader gathered us together. Having sized up the territory and considered several scenarios, he shared his thoughts about that night\\u2019s approach. A particularly important point he mentioned was that it was vital to remain flexible, and open to the possibility of modifying our plans if new evidence presented itself. So the initial direction was decided and tactics clarified. He had selected an old closed road farther up the ridge, up against the beginning of the older growth (probably 2nd growth) timber. Access to the road had been blocked years before by a berm, impossible for cars, yet fairly easy to traverse on foot. It was roughly midnight as we crossed the berm into what can only be described, based on everyone\\u2019s sudden change of mood, as \\u201csomeone or something else\\u2019s world\\u201d. The wind had finally all but stopped and it was now deathly quiet, except for the crunching of rocks under our boots. The brightness of the waxing moon lit the landscape and our company in shadowy shades of black and grey, with silvery highlights. Our shadows were black and well defined. One gentleman of our five-man team, a young veteran of a middle-east war, proudly clad in his fatigues, walked point, followed by the group leader and his son. I was next, having made sure to place myself as close to the middle of the company as possible, and finally, the oldest man in our group picked up the rear of the column. I think that older gentleman understood the value of being last, increasing the chance of being selected for contact. The old road cut across a slope near the top of the ridge. Below, a steep drop-off, choked with new growth, rhododendron and an assortment of other lush Western Oregon varieties of undergrowth. Above us, a dark shadowy stand of old trees, with silvery snags strewn throughout the forest floor; the wildest, most rugged terrain this area offers. We approached a large dead tree that had fallen across the road. As each in the company climbed over the log, signaling yet another barrier into another world, the group leader stopped. He had been carrying a tree knocker and now he would put it to good use. It was time to announce our presence. The group leader let loose with two sequences of knocks\\u2013 \\u201cpop pop\\u2026 pop, then pop, pop\\u201d. Each hit echoed through the forest and rebounded off the steep canyons with the force of a home-run. We all had enough experience to stay completely quiet and wait for a possible response. No crunching boots, no wind, dead silence. After a couple of minutes, we moved on. The older gentleman was the first to hear a response - a soft \\\"tap-tap.\\\" He stopped the group for a listen. The first contact had been paralleling us from below, down the hill in the thick brush. We stopped and listened, nothing, then continued on. I began nervously glancing back down the road behind our column. I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder if I might catch a brief glimpse of a dark figure slipping quietly across the road back up into the timber. We then came to a bend in the road. There was a wide turn-out covered with ground cover. Our eyes had continued to adjust, so the moon now lit our position on the landing like a large street light. Just as my mind was focused on all of this, just when I least expected it, the real knocking began.  At that moment, reality changed forever and everyone was transformed. All eyes, all thoughts, all senses were now directed toward the dark timber. Not 50 feet away the knocking continued. There among the old trees a shadowy figure, an intelligence controlling a hand, with an opposable thumb, wielding possibly a large stick, sending knocking sounds echoing through the dark cathedral forest. The knocking patterns seemed to be a coded message, letting us know that whoever or whatever it was, knew we were there. The army vet turned to me, I can still remember the excitement in his eyes as he exclaimed: \\u201cthat\\u2019s no woodpecker\\u201d, I replied: \\u201cthis is real!\\u201d. I heard my name and quickly turned to see the rest of the group on the ground. The group leader quietly ordered me to get down. There we sat as the group leader exchanged sounds and words with a creature that I now realized for the first time in my life was 100% real and just 50 feet away. Everyone of us felt the rush of being fully and acutely present, alert and alive. During these moments, nothing else seemed to matter. I asked myself, can this really be happening? \\u2026 It is! The group leader\\u2019s words may not have been understood, but his calming tone must have spoken volumes to the figure or figures beyond the tree-line.  We felt, as they must have, that neither was there to threaten the other. The knocks were not aggressive, simply a way to let us know they were there. Once the group leader thanked them for allowing us to share their space, he suggested that it might be time to retreat and not push things any further. We began hiking back toward the cars. It soon became apparent that our progress was now being flanked, and so it was, with glowing yellow-green and red eyes, vocalizations, and rustling all the way back to where we had parked. The following night would further reveal why we had been so closely monitored. Once back we were a buzz, we realized that we had all just been transformed, born again.

All of the buildings stood on higher ground... which dropped starting at the road, running behind the trailer where I lived. One evening we built a very large bonfire, about 60 or 70 ft. from the where the land started to descend. The fire had been burning for about a 20 minutes, when I heard an extremely loud vocalization. It sounded like a bird at first, but then upon listening more intently it distinctly sounded like a person shrilly screaming, like that was a sound intentionally being made. I dismissed it, thinking it to be a large waterfoul or something mundane...until it started to circling around us, on the land farther down the hill. It started from an area at the beginning of the property, which was woods and farmland all around, behind the trailer, and up further into the acreage. It seemed that whatever it was, was upset about the fire. I don't know any animal that would come CLOSER to the fire if it was upset by it. I thought that I knew what it was, but didn't want to think about it. Later, on a television show, I heard vocalizations believed to be Bigfoot. I actually started to cry, because they sounded just like what I heard.

I belong to a club of outdoor enthusiasts, we travel to certain locations to scratch a living from the earth for a few days and once you have the fever there's no such thing as a nonworking vacation. This last trip (June 2008) I had an experience I couldn't explain: I was asleep in my tent; I was the only person left in camp everyone else had packed up and left. I wasn't too concerned as I have camped by myself in this area several times and could only recall one other time when I felt like something was nearby perhaps a cougar or other predator type animal as the crickets stopped chirping and the whole area became extremely quiet. This particular night I was sleeping soundly and was then suddenly awake and aware that something was up, everthing was silent. I didn't know what had woken me at first but I reached over and checked my watch seeing that it was 3:11am I thought to myself I need to get back to sleep, then I heard it; someone or something was moving around in the stream below my camp. Not directly below, but more to the north and west of my camp following the curvature of the stream. Picture a curving \\\"L\\\" shape. Now rotate the \\\"L\\\" 1/4 turn to the right, apply that to moving stream water, my camp sits above the water 20 to 30 feet in the inside turn of the \\\"L\\\". I heard splashing in the stream and then, SMACK....SMACK. There was a pause of a few seconds then SMACK....SMACK....SMACK. It was two rocks being hit together in a pattern. Ok, creepy and not what I was expecting, I reached over and put a shell in the chamber of my weapon and checked the safety. I'll give it a few minutes and if nothing else happens I'll go back to sleep. Nothing else did happen except when the sun came up I packed up and left. The area around the stream is covered in rocks of every size and shape from small pebbles to boulders as big as cars and trucks. I didn't think to look for tracks. I was still the only one there and I didn't know what to think, except that if someone thought it was fun to show up at a secluded camp at that time of night to smack rocks together there must be something wrong with them and it's time to vacate the area.  A few months later I saw a program on primates and how they will knock rocks and sticks together to communicate I put two and two together and realized I may have had an encounter.\", \"location_details\": \"Take Hwy 14A west out of Sturgis\", \"county\": \"Lawrence County\", \"state\": \"South Dakota\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 25415: Possible nighttime visit while camping in the Black Hills of South Dakota\", \"latitude\": 44.38611, \"longitude\": -103.6183, \"date\": \"2008-06-22\", \"number\": 25415.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9xykd05ryd\", \"temperature_high\": 77.64, \"temperature_mid\": 67.765, \"temperature_low\": 57.89, \"dew_point\": 50.99, \"humidity\": 0.57, \"cloud_cover\": 0.13, \"moon_phase\": 0.62, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1016.44, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 130.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.03, \"location\": \"POINT(-103.6183 44.386109999999995)\"}, {\"observed\": \"i just started working as a police officer, and i was assigned the midnight shift. i was doing my basic patrols, when i was runing low on gas. the officer who was working the evening had the gas card with him and he lived approx. 7 miles south of wanblee on a gravel road. i did speak to him over the phone and he said that he'll be waiting for me to come get it. i drove out to his residence and i did get the card and i started driving back into wanblee. as i was coming over a hill (the ditch area is approx.4-5 feet deep, on both sides of the gravel road) my patrol unit was a chevy tahoe, which did sit kind of high to the ground. i was north-bound when i started to descend the hill i noticed some thing \\\"bobbing\\\" in the ditch (west side of the road) and i was kinda high off the ground. i thought it was a bat or a bird, so i did'nt think nothing of it. the next minute, i did saw something run across the road, right in front of me. it was running towards the east.  i did see what i think was the shoulder area to the thigh area, through the windshield. i had a side view of this thing. i could still remember seeing the reddish-brown hair which covered the thing. the hair looked to be approx. 4-5 inches in length. and the overall torso/body from what i could see, was slim. from the chest to the arms. the arms were long and slim, i do not remember seeing the hands. it only happened for a brief second or so, but what ever it was.....was very fast. i did stop and turn around to try to see what it was , but it was gone\", \"location_details\": \"i am quite surprised that there are no other reports, coming from the wanblee area. there is a creek running from a butte (8 miles south of wanblee) through wanblee and out to the badlands. and there is a rich history of sightings of bigfoots in this particular area.\", \"county\": \"Jackson County\", \"state\": \"South Dakota\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 13691: Police officer describes late night road crossing sighting south of Wanblee\", \"latitude\": 43.4471, \"longitude\": -101.7312, \"date\": \"2003-11-01\", \"number\": 13691.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9xxxjj39en\", \"temperature_high\": 35.89, \"temperature_mid\": 33.39, \"temperature_low\": 30.89, \"dew_point\": 26.24, \"humidity\": 0.83, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.27, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0014, \"precip_probability\": 0.56, \"precip_type\": \"snow\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 180.0, \"wind_speed\": 9.19, \"location\": \"POINT(-101.7312 43.4471)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I saw what I thought was a bear.

On the sixth day I walked by an area that had springs on both sides of the trail which alternated sides every so often. I noticed on this trip there was no animal sounds or activety and I felt watched. So I stopped and surveyed my surroundings and to the east of me about 25yds in the thick underbrush something quite robust in size and dark in color seemed to be crouched between a couple of trees looking in my direction. I thought it was a large hog or maybe a bear so I turned south heading toward home and this creature moved along with me keeping a distance of approximately 15-30yds between us at all times. We continued this kind of cat and mouse routine for about 20-25 minutes. I stopped to releave myself. Then suddenly I don't know what possessed me to turn into the woods toward this creature. It stopped and crouched very low to the ground and remained perfectly still. I had gotten into about 10 yds. and I got wind of a strange odor I can't describe I heard a low gutteral growl coming from the creature's area. I could see it was very dark in color and almost lying in a prone position much like a sniper lining up a shot it and human like legs only very hairy I could make out thick arms and shoulders also covered with thick hair probibly no more 1-2\\\" in length. It was down almost as if it was tring to hide it's face. I would estimate it to be no more than 6ft.tall.The hair on my neck stood up when I heard movement of something large moving in woods from accross the trail behind me. I moved quckly back onto the trail and it seemed I wasn't being followed so I slowed my pace, by this time I was about 100-125 yards from the point I had urinated I turned and saw this dark figure walk upright out of the east woods and stop at my puddle area it squatted for a few second then stood up and looked directly at me for a few more seconds. It head turned abruptly toward the west woods and much larger dark being came slightly into view they both watched me as I back peddled watching them for another dozen or so yards when I decide home was the best place to be and ran off.\", \"location_details\": \"Hwy105@Crockett Martin\", \"county\": \"Montgomery County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 10733: Hiker has daytime encounter in Sam Houston National Forest\", \"latitude\": 30.31667, \"longitude\": -95.32, \"date\": \"2002-04-17\", \"number\": 10733.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9vkhqyyp7h\", \"temperature_high\": 84.47, \"temperature_mid\": 77.27, \"temperature_low\": 70.07, \"dew_point\": 70.4, \"humidity\": 0.8, \"cloud_cover\": 0.73, \"moon_phase\": 0.16, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1018.19, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy until evening.\", \"uv_index\": 6.0, \"visibility\": 9.37, \"wind_bearing\": 144.0, \"wind_speed\": 9.03, \"location\": \"POINT(-95.32 30.316670000000002)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Deer hunting in the Sam Houston National Forest last November (2003). Near dark, I heard what sounded like a large limb or small tree snap. I listened, but heard nothing further.  Next day, I returned before sun-up, and spent the day hunting the area.  Late afternoon, I hid in a clump of small trees near the edge of the field.  As darkness fell, I heard a mumbling sound, like someone was whispering.  No words could be made out, although individual syllables were definately distinguishable.  The sound was coming from the thick woods and sounded maybe 300 yards distant.  Sounded quite human, but carried far better than I would think human whispering would.  Most syllables seemed to start with \\\"s\\\" sounds.  I listened for a while, then said \\\"who's there?\\\" No reply, and silence for maybe 10 minutes.  Then the chattering resumed.  The source of the sounds seemed to move around, but I took it to be one critter, changing location.  It was very dark by now, and I turned on my flashlight and moved into the woods to try to see what was making the sounds.  As I walked, the source of the chattering seemed to maintain it's distance.  I spotted a \\\"hair\\\" on a sapling bent over the game trail that I was following. It (the \\\"hair\\\") was later analyzed by a competent scientist and determined to be of plant origin. As I walked, I realized that I would have to be within 10 or 20 yards of something to see it. Not likely, so I reversed direction and left for the night. No odors were noticed.  I have returned to the location many times since, and found nothing.  That is until a few weeks ago, and almost a year after my first \\\"encounter\\\". October, 2004, same location: Bow hunting, I spotted a few does on the way in, but could not get a clear shot. I passed. Later, kicked up something, but had no visual contact (probably a deer). Near dark, I decided to walk the fire trail quietly.  A few hundred yards in, I found a somewhat human shaped footprint along the side of the firetrail.  It was the same length as my size 12 EEE boot [14 inches], but quite a bit wider at the \\\"toe\\\" end.  The \\\"toes\\\" also seemed to end rather evenly, and not the arched, rounded look of a human track. As I photographed, I noticed an odor, mild at first, and quickly becoming quite powerful. I would describe it as complex, layered. The predominant odor was of sour sweat. I could also smell decaying flesh, and a musky undertone. I finished photographing the best track (there were several other \\\"impressions\\\"), and photographed the woods directly behind me, from where I felt the odor eminated. I slowly and quietly walked back to my truck (20 minutes), and set my bow in the bed of the pickup as I retreived my keys from my pocket. It was completely dark by now, and overcast. Something growled at me. It was close, maybe 25 yards. The growl lasted between 1 and 2 seconds. I waited a good 5 minutes staring at the woods where the growl came from, then reached to my flashlight and turned it on. Nothing. The woods are incredibly thick here, and I could hide from someone easily in there. I had at least expected to see eye-shine. I keep plaster in my truck after the former incident, last November. Although I was entertaining the thought of going back in to make a casting, the growl made me think better of it. Had I been carrying my sidearm or a rifle, I would have done so, but not with a bow in complete darkness. That growl, while not loud, sounded serious.

I am a good judge of distance for I am a bow hunter and I estimated it to be 45 to 50 yards away. It had a long sloping forehead and very defined brow ridge. I could not tell what color its hair was but I noticed a long beard and its arms hung down to almost his knees. I struggled to get my phone out to take a picture by the time I got it out it turned and walked into the woods. I think it might have been going for the calf.

We had made camp near an unnamed pond west of the Hiking Trail. The night was clear, 35 degrees, and perfectly still. My friend and I were hammock camping and, because of the cold, were both under low-staked tarps that prevented us from seeing out. Our hammocks were about 15 yards apart. At 6 a.m. it was still completely dark. I had been awake for about 15 minutes but remained in my sleeping bag inside my hammock. At that point I heard a sharp clack perhaps 75 yards on the other side of my friend. Two seconds later I heard a double-knock much farther away, perhaps a \\u00bd mile to the north or northwest. The first pop was crisp and close. To my ears it had to be either rock on rock or wood on wood. As there is nothing in that area but sandy soil and trees, my conclusion was that this was a well-struck tree knock followed by a distant response. To the best of our knowledge there were no other people in the vicinity. We had arrived at the trail head to begin our one-night backpacking trip at 2 p.m. the previous afternoon, and we had only seen one other party of hikers, who passed our camp at 4:30 Sunday afternoon and continued eastward on the trail; we saw no one else during the entire trip, which ended when we arrived back at the parking lot at 11:30 a.m. Monday morning. Had it been windy I could have written the sounds off to cracking limbs, but there was not the slightest breeze, and the two sounds appeared to me to be a clear call and response, perhaps: \\u201cHumans over here\\\" \\u2026 \\\"Roger that.\\u201d After the sounds, I froze and listened hard for several minutes for any other noise such as footfalls, stick breaks or other evidence of visitors but heard none. Within five minutes I asked my friend if he had heard it and he had not, having his ears covered by his cap and his head inside his sleeping bag at the time. Within 15 minutes we both were asleep again. We awoke for good at about 7:20 a.m. and vacated the area at 10 a.m. We heard distant coyotes, dogs, ducks, and owls, but no other such sounds during our stay. The absence of footfalls or other noises initially made me think it must have not been a sasquatch, but on reflection, the visitor could easily have frozen in his spot when he discovered our camp and then moved slowly away, perhaps using fallen logs, 15 minutes later once we were back to sleep. Considering the stillness of the night, the crisp, unambiguous clack, and the quick double-knock response, I can think of no other cause for these sounds.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Montgomery County\", \"state\": \"Texas\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 50643: Camper hears possible wood knock and distant reply in the Sam Houston National Forest\", \"latitude\": 30.52897, \"longitude\": -95.72607, \"date\": \"2016-01-04\", \"number\": 50643.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9v7vttwkhu\", \"temperature_high\": 59.82, \"temperature_mid\": 46.33, \"temperature_low\": 32.84, \"dew_point\": 35.4, \"humidity\": 0.7, \"cloud_cover\": 0.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.83, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1025.69, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 19.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.01, \"location\": \"POINT(-95.72606999999999 30.52897)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Multiple encounters driving into my subdivision around 1 - 3 AM See deer dispersing and in my rear view mirror hairy large upright thing running at me.

This freaked me out. I am an experienced outdoors-man and have logged several hundred days afield over the past 35 years. I have walked for hours by flashlight to get to hunting stands and have never ever seen eyes this shape and of this brilliance and set this far apart before. Before these occurrences I was very skeptical of all the Bigfoot stories and sightings I have seen or read about, but now I am open to the possibility that there is something out there that could fit the description of a Bigfoot.

But she was in fact, in bed with us, on point looking out the bedroom window. The draggin sounds were long footsteps coming from outside. We listened to them for about 20 seconds or so as they were getting closer.  A silhouette then quickly, but smoothly, passed right by the window.  We quietly listened until we could not hear anymore footsteps, and then talked about what it may have been for a little while until we decided to just go back to sleep (our dog ALWAYS growls and barks at people, but she didnt, so we figured it was just an animal, or a tree limb swinging past the window).

From a childhood spent in North Georgia to stints in West Virginia and now (for the past 16 years) in Virginia, I have spent a great bit of time in the woods. I know animals and flora and that is why what occurred back in the fall of '03 has bothered me so much to this day, enough to finally submit this report. My former roommate's father owns the property this incident took place on. I have had access to it since I was 15. It's a small sportsman\\u2019s paradise of nearly 200 acres and a 5-acre bass pond. I had hunted it every fall since '94 and had fished there for years before that. I hit the woods, completely scent proof, at about 3:30AM and hiked from the farmhouse appx. 600 yards back to the deer stand I was planning on using that morning. I stopped short about 100 yards to apply a drag rope (doe in rut scent) and then crossed the creek bridge and walked a wide pattern out in front of the stand to put out several scent markers on the game trails. This took perhaps 15 minutes and no game animals were spooked. I then headed back towards the tree stand, tied off my rifle and gear to a safety rope, climbed the stand and pulled up my gear. This would give me a full hour and a half to let the woods settle down and help my presence go unnoticed. What happened next has cost me countless nights of sleep and still gives me chills every time I think about it. Once in the stand I went about the business of sorting out my gear and making sure everything was where I would need it, binoculars, grunt caller, etc. Out of nowhere came the most god awful, blood-curling scream/yell/growl that I had ever heard in my life. The morning calm was completely shattered and it sounded close. I immediately ran the a mental list in my mind as to what it could be, but nothing I had ever heard before could match this in either pitch, depth, or duration. It lasted for at least 5-7 seconds. I was scared. It started so high and just kept expanding in pitch into a howl that ended in a menacing guttural growl. Before the sound was even over I realized/felt extreme danger. The real fear was from the fact that the volume was so loud and it came upon me so suddenly that I knew it was close, too close, within say 25 yards. Following the \\\"howl\\\" there was complete silence. I immediately felt to close to the ground, for whatever reason (in a 17ft. tree stand), and carefully stood up so that my feet were not dangling off the seat. I pulled out my mag light and started scanning the area to my front and right that the sound seemed to come from. I tried to listen for further movement while scanning, but realized that my ears were actually ringing from the howl. I remember thinking (from previous survival training) to keep cool and not panic, and figure this out. I quickly chambered a round and checked to make sure the safety was on my rifle, a Winchester model 70 in .300WSM. I then continued scanning between the woods to my front and the pine thicket to my immediate right with my flashlight. I just felt so vulnerable, and remembered thinking that this rifle might not be enough so I fetched my S&W.40 handgun from my backpack and secured it to my belt (now I know that it's unlawful to carry a sidearm during rifle season, but there are black bear on this property and I wasn\\u2019t going to leave myself without an option). It took several moments for my hearing to return and when it did I heard distinctive movement back in the pine thicket to my front and right, maybe 20 yards into the trees. Then nothing. That\\u2019s when the smell hit me. I'm not sure I noticed it at first because I had been handling deer scents, but I smelled what I can only describe as a \\\"rotten cabbage/ripe dumpster\\\". It didn\\u2019t last long, and there was no noticeable wind at the time of this incident to carry this scent. I stood there in that tree stand for the next two hours until first light and then got the hell out of there. I'm not the type to scare easily and I was right back out there two days later, but didn\\u2019t think to check for tracks or any other evidence. The game was still scarce. I've been back several times since then to fish the pond and nothing out of the ordinary ever occurred during those trips. I totally forgot about this incident for nearly a year. It bothered me so I just didn\\u2019t think about it. That changed when I caught a documentary on T.V. concerning bigfoot/Sasquatch. The BFRO was mentioned and I found your website out of curiosity. I was stunned when I read the report (also in Franklin Co.) that you had listed, but was even further stunned when I listened to some of the recording in your database. Several (from '73 and '78 I think) sounded similar to the very beginning of the howl during my incident, but the sound I heard was so close and loud and went so deep at the end that they are tough to compare. Whatever made that noise had one hell of a set of lungs though. I was also surprised about the smell that \\\"they\\\" supposedly emit when threatened. I had no idea. That was the icing on the cake that made me think that I might have possibly had an encounter. I've always been someone comfortable in the woods, and for the most part I'm still that person, I'm just a little more aware of what could possibly be out there.\", \"location_details\": \"From Roanoke: 220 South to Rocky Mount, then 40 West past Ferrum College\", \"county\": \"Franklin County\", \"state\": \"Virginia\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 13212: Possible pre-dawn vocalization heard by hunter near Ferrum\", \"latitude\": 36.94165, \"longitude\": -80.04166, \"date\": \"2003-11-13\", \"number\": 13212.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dnx44t52wn\", \"temperature_high\": 45.65, \"temperature_mid\": 38.555, \"temperature_low\": 31.46, \"dew_point\": 21.67, \"humidity\": 0.4, \"cloud_cover\": 0.24, \"moon_phase\": 0.64, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0002, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.11, \"summary\": \"Breezy throughout the day and partly cloudy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 3.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 295.0, \"wind_speed\": 17.47, \"location\": \"POINT(-80.04166 36.94165)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was ridding my atv on the family farm going down an old washed out road which you can\\u2019t drive fast on.

The sun was to my left shining across this road to the right as I looked down this narrow road there was a reflection of the light coming off the fur of something that I never had seen before,it was tall and massive. For that split second I saw it. The way the suns reflection came off of this thing it look almost silver. But being a hunter (I hunt this land all the time) There isn\\u2019t anything silver in color. And that the sun coming off the back of a black turkey can look silver.

No, but I had no explination of what it was I was seeing. As I slowed down, the animal which was standing on two legs steped over the guard rail and turned to start walking up the hill.

Behind me is a LARGE picture window looking out onto a neighbors field and beyond that is Warehouser land. As I was playing with my back turned to the window. I had a \\\"Someones watching me feeling\\\" I turned around and there, approximately 10 feet in front of me,watching me play piano, is this hairy creature. He was taller than the picture window because he was bending to see in. His arms were long, his eyes were reddish brown as was his hair. It became darker on his main body, but was lighter on his face and chest area. His upper body was pretty buff. It took me a while to scream as I was frozen in fear for a bit but when I did finally scream he took off. My dad ran out and saw the back of it running away. my grandparents and sisters in brother saw it run by the camper and then dad saw it run through our field to the creek.So that's 6 people that saw it.

(It was Summer) The truck was parked a little away from our house by the barn. We were both in bed talking and suddenly the light from the house was blocked out. I saw a face in the topper side window looking at us. At first I thought it was one of my siblings but as my eyes adjusted to the light change I realized it was the hairy face I had seen in the picture window months before. I then froze and whispered to my friend also not to move. It watched for what seemed like an eternity. Maybe waiting for us to move,which we didn't! Then it moved towards the open back gate window, to our Horror. I thought it was coming to get us,but it never showed up back there. When we got up the courage to get out and go to my house. We told everyone what had happened. They had all been together watching a movie. No one there had been away from the rest.Those are my 2 accounts.

We live in Winlock Lewis County  off of the Hart Rd.  Back in 1980 our property and the surrounding acres were undeveloped and just Fir trees , Cedar trees, and lots of scrub brush .  Also there is a swamp at the end of our driveway.  My family owns fifteen acres .  Anyway our driveway ran half a mile right next to the pipeline and there was thick brush and trees on either side of it.  One day about 5 pm after school I was walking up our driveway and I heard something in the brush just off to my left.  I had seen deer, rabbits , porcipines, possums,and whylee .  But this was different.  This creature was walking just off my left side and staying with me, the faster I walked, the faster it walked.  You could tell it was a bi-pedal creature by the way it was walking.  As I got closer to the last 100yrds it stayed back and then it was gone.  That night my sister and I were sleeping in our half built home in sleepig bags on the floor.  About 2am this sound came from the woods behind our home that was like a Ape (it was a woop-woop, kind of sound) only so loud and unlike anything Ive ever heard before. Then ofter the woops- I we heard this long drawn out wailing cry, that was sad sounding to me. Considering what had happened to me during the previous day, I have to think they are conected.  Since that day and that night I never heard the sound again, nor has anything ever followed me like that , up or down the driveway.  I almost think whatever it was , was upset we were developing that property.  I have hunted and fished my whole life and never have heard or seen the trees bend right next to me as something walked with two legs right next to me , yet unseen.  Nor have I heard the sounds of that night. I have seen all the animals that live here and I have photographed and hunted them all.  I am 43  now  and have no reason to bring this up.  The only reason I am is so maybe others will realize what is happening to them when something like this happens.  I knew what it was yet I was 14 yrs old  and my parents would of laughed it off as nothing.  To this day I know that Bigfoot followed me up my driveway and then Bigfoot let me know what he was by the calls in the middle of the same night.  If you heard these sounds you would of thought the woops where a Orangatang swinging in the trees, until you heard the deep hollow crys after.  These are what sold me.  That cry is definately only made by The big guy himself. Thanks for your time.  Hunters be aware of what is all around you and what could happen to you. Thankyou, and enjoy the great wildrness we are priveledged to live next to. The area the four hunters experienced their encounter was right above the Green River Hatchery and I have frequented that log rd many times.  I know it like the back of my hand.  As I read the documentation of what happened it gave me chills .  Thankyou for believing in the truth and what is really out there.

We had been sitting for about five minutes when we heard something behind us and to the right at a good distance away (several hundred yards at least). There were limbs snapping and tree tops knocking together and then something we couldn't recognize.

We tried to figure out what it might have been but we figured maybe it was the trees rubbing together or something similar. It certainly didn't sound like any animal we had ever heard or heard of. We remained sitting there for a few more minutes (2 or 3) when we heard it again. This time it sounded as if it was literally on the other side of the tree from us!

A crab apple tree had grown on the edge of the property, practically hanging out in the road (Hwy 7).  The farm my family lived on was surrounded by trees, and we could constantly hear the wind run through them.  But we heard a different type of tree movement from the crab apple tree by the highway, and it caught our attention.  It sounded like something pushing the branches in, and fruit snapping off.  We got off of the truck and walked toward the tree. When we were about 15 feet from the tree, the noise stopped.  Then we saw it. A large, pale \\\"animal\\\"  upright on two legs.  It paid us little mind as it jogged out from behind the tree, and loped across the highway with a \\\"swish, swish, swish\\\" sound from it's feet.  It sounded like someone rubbing two pieces of sand paper together.  I was transfixed by the legs.  They remained so strait, and took such long strides.  The left arm swung in huge, deliberate strokes, and other than the feet swishing, we heard no noise.  No labored breathing, creeky joints, Nothing.  The visual  portion was as follows: Pale colored.  Not brown at all. Infact, almost a \\\"dirty white\\\" color. Long, slender limbs. Not fat or \\\"bulky\\\". Hair on legs seemed to be around 5 or 6 inches long, and swung back and forth with leg motion. Definitely had a \\\"hand\\\", which swung in large, forceful movements. It was hanging onto what I believe to be my parents crab apple. We were unable to move for what seemed like hours, but must have been only a few seconds. It continued down the highway, and when we came to our heads, in nervous excitement we ran for the truck cab to turn on the headlights.  Too late, it was out of site.  We ran inside, grabbed flashlights, and after trying to explain to my family what had just happened, ended up dragging half of them out into the woods in the \\\"animals\\\" last known direction of travel. Needless to say, we heard and found nothing. The next day, tracks could be found, although they were not the type you would expect.  They were scuffs of tracks from the animal dragging its feet, not the clear, easily identifiable tracks you see on TV, etc...The crab apple tree had a signifigent section of broken branches, and two pieces of apple laying on the ground.\", \"location_details\": \"State highway 7, 5 miles toward Morton from Elbe.\", \"county\": \"Lewis County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 4380: Dirty white animal seen near apple orchard\", \"latitude\": 46.7002, \"longitude\": -122.1983, \"date\": \"1994-07-15\", \"number\": 4380.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c231em9bmh\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.1983 46.7002)\"}, {\"observed\": \"R. and I had been fishing all day at the Duck Ponds.

Both occurred within a mile of each other yet were decades apart. Having read the report from a hunter near a lake outside of Packwood I wanted to submit this as his encounter and mine are very similar and may be the same creature. The first encounter was in the mid 70's. The location was Chambers Lake SE of Packwood and close to The Goat Rocks Wilderness. It was early spring with the access road to the lake buried in heavy snow. We had walked in approximately 3 miles leaving my dads car at the creek. There were no human tracks leading into the area. Only the weather worn tracks of what looked like a forestry snowcat. We fished for brook trout from the logs near the camping area. We had caught several when we heard the sound of shifting rock on the slope across the lake from our location. As the slope was buried in several feet of snow it had to be something large to displace the rocks. Maybe ten minutes later something let out a horrible screaming howl from the tree line that borders the lake directly below the slope. It was incredibly loud and forceful. It scared both my dad and I. It then sounded like it was tearing up the brush and limbs. So my dad said we needed to leave. My father was a judge and not easily intimidated but he was visibly frightened. He grabbed our rods and took out his pistol. He said 'come on' and started walking without even reeling in the lines. We hiked up the snow covered access road and down the logging road. My dad kept looking back behind us as we could still here the thrashing sounds until we were 1/2 mile away. We finally got to the car and left The second encounter was in 1998. It occurred approximately 1 mile from the lake. My friend and I had just arrived to hunt elk in the area between Chambers and Walupt Lake. It was November. We were truck camping on a gravel site that overlooks the valley. It is on the same ridgeline that leads to the slope behind Chambers Lake. It was evening and we were sitting beside a fire discussing the next days hunt. Suddenly there was that same horrific screaming howl coming from the treeline approximately 100 yards from our truck. The creature was very loud and was moving closer as it vocalized. We could hear what sounded like logs or limbs being thrown in our direction. We quickly got into the truck and spent the night in the cab. We did not here further vocalizations but also didn't go out to listen either. Let me note that I am a lifelong hunter with extensive knowledge of animal behavior and identification. I am also a well educated naturalist that could identify most every Cascade animal by sound. This was not a bear, cougar, elk, porcupine, wolf, coyote or bobcat. I would doubt it was a human as it was obvious that we were hunters and the distance was within east range for either of us. This was the exact same noise I heard with my father two decades earlier and within a mile of the first encounter. In subsequent years I have hiked the game trails along that ridgeline and they connect between both locations with well worn paths. In fact the truck was parked across the path as it transects the gravel site. It appears as if this is a creature that lives in that area and doesn't want people infringing on its territory / food supplies (we were fishing and hunting during these events).

A couple years back we had found a closed road that lead up to an enchanting pocket of old growth forest which allowed for decent visibility yet had vegetation that would seem to be sufficient to hide and feed wildlife.  I find old growth forests magical, but my brother found this spot somewhat spooky, due to its isolation and dead still quiet.  Nonetheless, we walked the 1.5 miles up the road into this forest, where the road terminates in a small ridge and a pocket of thick, second growth fir beyond that.  We seperated about 75 yards and sat for about a half hour just watching and listening.  That's when we heard some unusual sounds.  To my mind, they were kind of like a bird hoot or something, but the sounds were loud and nothing I'd ever heard before (not an owl).  These sounds occurred two or three times.  When my brother and I reunited, we both mentioned these sounds to each other and were confused because they were unusual to us both.  He did not think they sounded at all like a bird.  Since we had been out all day, we then decided to retire and head back down the trail.

As my Mom left she reminded me to lock up, so I went to the door to lock it. As I locked the door, I watched my Mom and her friend drive past throught the window on the left side of my door. When I looked out side I noticed the outline of a pair of legs strolling through my neighbors yard. My first thought was that someone wearing adidas pants was going through my neighbor's yard and that some on must be snooping around. Being the nosy person that I am, I cupped my hands on the glass to get a better look. When I did, I saw a large dark redish brown brown figure with long stringy hair, About 8.5' tall. It seemed so musclular and it's legs did not straighten but remained bent. As it walked it swayed it's arms back and forth as I watched in amazement. When I realized it it was something out of the ordinary I panicked and jumped back behind the door. When I looked back it was gone, Moments later the phone rang, it was my Mom on her cellular phone. She sounded very startled when I answered it and automatically ordered me to make sure the dog was in and all the doors and windows locked because she had just seen something very weird. On hearing this I was relieved that I wasn't losing my mind. She said they were almost to the end of my street when a large animal with long reddish brown hair crossed the road in front of them and took one easy step over my neighbors barbed wire fence (mom clarified it was a metal gate) and kept going.  In interviewing the mom, she explained to me that she might have seen the sasquatch Chris was looking at if she had looked to the left into her neighbors yard as she drove by. But, her and her girl friend were distracted looking down the street at a very large man standing next to a 6' 6\\\" street sign. The top of the sign came about mid chest level. It stood still like it was hiding behind the sign. When they got closer to it, it bolted, taking two steps to clear the road and striding down her neighbors driveway and stepped over the metal 4' gate in one easy step. She said \\\"the long reddish brown hair swung back and forth as it swung it's arms.

I remember I saw blood, and noticed the arm was slouched to one side. It looked right at me, as it walked across the street. It had a sad expression. I could tell it was hurt. I said to myself, \\\"your bigger than me, you go right ahead\\\" and then I drove home. It happened so fast. I didn't tell anyone this story, until my son came home telling about his teacher talking about sasquatch and encouraged me to talk to him. I wonder how many people don't tell other about what they saw. The skin was black and leathery around the nose and eyes and the ears were pointed and protruded through the hair on the side of the head.

It walked real slow looking at us and then slid down the embankment catching it's balance with it hand. it was moving toward the woods that leads to the river. Every one was real quiet. When we got home mom kept saying it was a bear. But it did not look like a bear to me. The back and shoulders were shaped like a triangle, very wide and tapered to the small of it's back, big muscles all over. Someone had shot it in the lower back. You could see the blood and matted hair. It was slouched forward and to one side, the side it had been shot on. Told my teacher about it the next day at school. It was a sandy brown and black color. S's account: I noticed it coming onto the road. It walked on two legs. It was light brown in colored and walked like a human but more slouched over, it appeared to be hurt and it was walking really slow.

I hope that it isn\\u2019t useless to you. I guess I need to tell you about the area I lived in first before I start into the rest of the story because there is a lot to it, and I think it will be confusing if I just stumble into it. In Washington state there is a town called Morton. It is an old logging community and it has a population of around 1500. It is surrounded on all four sides by mountains, and is located along highway 12, about 45 minutes east of Interstate 5 past Mayfield lake and north of rife lake. The town is only about 1 square mile in all and when you look at road maps it is truly in the middle of freakin\\u2019 no where. In fact, it is about 2 miles south of the southeastern tip of the Snoqualmie national forest. When I lived there though I was 11 years old and I didn\\u2019t know any of that. I only bring it up now because this asks for information on the area and how to get there. I lived on 7th street. When you look at the map it is the very first street you come to when traveling east along highway 12, and we were the third house from the highway. Directly across from my house is the Graveyard. It isn\\u2019t well lit, but there are a few lights, a lot of shrubs, and a few huge trees, as well as a huge hedge wall along the right side of it, when looking at it from my house.  On the other side of the hedge is the power plant, and it is super well lit. There are light posts all over and you can see everything over there. To the left when looking out my window is highway 12, and there is a large hill directly on the other side of the highway. It hadn\\u2019t been logged when I saw this, but the next year they did some stuff up there. That\\u2019s probably not important, but anyway\\u2026 to the meat of this whole thing\\u2026 Like I said I was 11 or so. My family had moved up from California for work and we took the first place we could get. I\\u2019m not going to lie the place was a piece of junk. It was drafty and poorly insulated, and whoever lived there before must have had 100 cats they let pee everywhere because it stunk too. It has since been re built a bit but at the time it was a little blue shack that didn\\u2019t have a bedroom because it had burnt down before we bought it. Because of that I slept on the couch, and my brother slept in the reclining chair. it\\u2019s the north window of the house that I slept next too, facing the street, and I used to sit there at night looking out the window at the stars and hoping deer would come eat my neighbors flowers so I could see one up close. Most people in morton are older, and all my neighbors were elderly\\u2026 the town has the only local hospital so a lot of older folks live there. Anyway, she always complained about the dear eating her roses or something, and I just wanted to see the stupid deer. Having come from Cali, I\\u2019d never seen one in real life. So there I was, laying on the couch propped up with my head peeping out from under the curtain waiting for deer. It was a towel actually, we didn\\u2019t have curtains, but it worked just as well I guess. The towel left about a 4 inch gap at the bottom before the sill where you could see outside without moving the curtain at all. Most nights nothing happened, and it became a habit for me to just look outside. We didn\\u2019t have cable TV or anything, just the videos my uncle would send us of shows he\\u2019d recorded, and I couldn\\u2019t read a book because my brother got mad if the lights were on, so it was the only way I could wind down before I went to bed. Most days I didn\\u2019t see anything but starts, but one day I saw a deer chillin out there eating grass or something, and I just thought it was the coolest darn thing ever! I watched it for a long time as it just kinda walked around and\\u2026 ate stuff, I guess. Having seen hundreds of deer since then I kinda laugh thinking about it but MAN was it ever cool at the time. So I\\u2019m sitting there, watching the deer, and all of a sudden it sticks its head strait up in the air and looks behind it and freezes. Then it took off running, veering left and right and changing directions, but I couldn\\u2019t see what was chasing it at first, until it ran back towards the mortuary where there is actually some light and then I was even more awestruck because it looked like a bear was chasing it! It was this big, thick, kinda fat looking thing, running on all fours and I couldn\\u2019t see a tail so I figured it couldn\\u2019t be a wolf, but man was it ever fast! It was so cool! I never knew bears could run fast and I\\u2019d certainly never seen one before, and then the deer ran behind the mortuary, around the other side, and back towards my house with the bear right behind it. The bear was catching up, but then the deer ran right into the road and ran around the hedge into the power plant area, where it just stopped and stood there in the light. The bear didn\\u2019t follow it, and kinda hung out in the shadows for a while. I could see it moving around but it was all dark. Maybe a minute went by and then the bear walked back towards highway 12 real slow, just taking its time. Well, there was a little ditch before the highway, and then the guard rail\\u2026 and I was watching it walk over it, and that\\u2019s when it stood up. It just stood up and walked over it, walked across the road on two legs, stepped over the other guard raid, and went up into the hill across from the highway. I had NO idea what to make of it. I knew bears could stand up on two legs but I knew they couldn\\u2019t walk like that... I mean it just walked right like I would have. I never told anyone about it because I thought I\\u2019d get in trouble. I had gone to a private Christian school in Cali and so making up stories got you in trouble, and I really didn\\u2019t want to get detention.  I never told that story to anyone as a \\u201creal\\u201d story I should say\\u2026 I have always told my friends its A \\u201cmonster story\\u201d and added stuff about huge fangs and stupid stuff because I just needed to get it OUT, you know?  But I didn\\u2019t want people to think I was crazy\\u2026 I was trying to fit in to a new school\\u2026 Later in the year I was watching a tape my uncle had sent to us and a comercial for burger king 99 cent whoppers came on. I thought it was stupid because there were no burger kings here, so I muted it and turned my head towards the window. When I looked out the window I saw a pair of eyes looking back at me, glowing from the light of the TV. I was scared and threw my blanket over my head and held absolutely still. I could hear something running away from the window, but I think that may have just been a curious couger\\u2026 Everything ive read about bigfoots, since someone finally told me about them the year after I saw the thing chase the deer in the graveyard, has said that they are very shy and wouldn\\u2019t come up to a house like that. Anyway, that\\u2019s my two stories. I hope they are somehow helpful. I also hope maybe you can give me some insight? I really don\\u2019t know what I saw still, but the only thing that makes sense anymore is if it were a Bigfoot.\", \"location_details\": \"Its litterally just on the edge of town in morton.

Below is a synopsis of that interview. About eight years ago the witness and his wife lived in western Washington, near the town of Winlock.  The couple owned several horses and spent a great deal of time riding them on the trails and logging roads near their home.    One sunny afternoon in late spring or early summer they were riding on a logging road in a wooded area when the witness saw what he describes as a \\u201cchimp-like\\u201d animal cross the dirt road in front of them. According to the witness, the animal was a couple hundred yards in front of him and the sighting lasted only a couple seconds.  He described the animal as \\u201cMoving fast, using its arms to help it along, exactly like a chimpanzee does.\\u201d  He said the animal was black in color.  Due to the distance and the short duration of the sighting he didn\\u2019t get a good look at the animal\\u2019s face.  He remembered the animal\\u2019s arms were \\u201cLong and skinny,\\u201d and were much longer than its legs.  He never saw the animal stand up, but estimated that if it stood erect it would have been about five feet tall.  He said the animal moved very fast, \\u201cAbout the speed of a loping horse,\\u201d and disappeared into the vegetation on the other side of the road. The witness said he\\u2019s very familiar with bears and is positive the animal he saw wasn\\u2019t a bear.  He stated, \\u201cIf this was a bear it was a horribly deformed bear.\\u201d  He felt that such a bear would not have been able to move as fast as the animal he saw.   He further stated that bears seen in profile tend to have a rather horizontal back, while the animal he saw had a steeply slanted back due to the arms being a lot longer than the legs.  He related that bears have a noticeable neck, but the animal he saw seemed to have little or no neck. After the brief sighting the couple rode their horses to the spot where the animal crossed the road.  At that point the horses became very frightened and hard to control.  The witness says the horses refused to go further and became so unmanageable that they eventually had to turn around and go back the way they had come.  The witness said he and his wife had ridden those horses on that same stretch of road \\u201cHundreds of times,\\u201d and never before or after the sighting did the horses  refuse to move forward.  The witness also related that he has ridden his horses in close proximity to bears and the horses never acted as frightened and unmanageable as when they saw the \\u201cChimp-like\\u201d animal. The area where the sighting took place was typical western Washington forest with a lot of salal bushes, large ferns, vine maples, and big fir trees.  The area is generally mountainous, although the place where the animal was seen was relatively flat.

I had my son and a friend of his in the boat with me.  We had pulled up to a point and shut down to start fishing when I scanned the clearcut like I always do looking for deer or elk.  About 150 yards off of the shore, I noticed something walking.  My first thought was \\\"it sure is awful warm to be bundled up like that\\\" and then immediately thought \\\"your coat sleeves are really long\\\".  I then said to the boys, \\\"hey look, a sasquatch\\\".  They both spotted it and it was walking away from us at a 45* angle looking back over its left shoulder.  It went behind a big stump and we didn't see it for several seconds.  It came out from the other side and stood facing us and just looked at us for probably 30 seconds.  At this point we all got serious because we could tell that it didn't appear to be a human and I know it was not a bear.  It turned and started walking away from us looking back ever so often.  It stopped just before going down a little raven and stood looking at us again.  It went down in the ravene and up the other side then disappeared into the timber.  The boys were very \\\"excited & nervous\\\" by now.  We discussed this amongst ourselves and I guess we watched this thing for close to 5 minutes.  I am originally from Arkansas, just a farm boy who has hunted and fished all of my life.  I have heard people talk about these things for years and haven't given them much thought one way or another.  What we saw definetly was not human, it was hairy from head to toe and was large, I don't know how tall.  It walked with long strides and it's arms & hand swung in an long swings as it walked.

I now consider myself a skeptic.  I started out on 01 Nov 02 on my very first elk hunt.  All my friends told me to go and hunt in Packwood.  So being in the Army I did a good map recon. Talked to the locals and head out for my hunt.  I drove about about 30 minutes north of Packwood on the 02 Nov 03 The day was kinda warm. So I packed light. I had my rifle, pistol and a small day pack with camera. I hiked about 5 hours till I got to the top of the ridge line. Stop for lunch and decided to take some pictures cause it was so beautiful up there.  There where small patches of snow behind rocks and trees where the sun couldn't reach.  As I walked around a big rock I' saw these tracks that took my breath away. Well I'm not one to scare quickly and there is not much that scares me except sharks but after see these tracks in the snow. It made me feal very uneasy. After calming down I pulled out my camera and took these 2 photos the last 2 pictures in the camera. My foot is a 11 regular but the track was about 2\\\" wider and maybe 3\\\" longer. After taking the last picture something threw a rock. It didnt push it or it didnt fall on its own it was about 150 meters away but when the rock hit it started alot of other rocks to fall. So I took out my bino's and glassed in the direction the rock came.  I could see what looked like a indention in the rocks. So after I calmed down again I decided to come down off that mountain kinda quickly.  Again I'm not a believe but something spooked me I guess it's the fear of the unknown.  Sincerely SSG Brian R.

The witnesses arrived at the logging site on July 20th 2003.  Their job was night watchmen over the logging equipment.  It was their responsibility. They were on duty all night. They were off duty during the daylight hours while the equipment was being used. First Site: The first location is where most of the activity occurred.  From the gate the pond is three miles up the road on what they call the Main Line.  The trailer was parked a mile further down the road beyond the pond.  A large clear cut was on the north side of the trailer site.  A road ran north through the clear cut, bending to the east about in the middle.  A spur road extended north from the bend in the road and ended at the tree line. First encounter \\u2013 The pond. Date: August 1st Time: Dusk Moon: New The couple was fishing at the pond in the late afternoon.  They had been fishing for about an hour when suddenly the first creature screamed, then in a few seconds the second creature screamed.  It was just getting dark.  The witnesses could not see what they were, but said that the creatures were only about 40 yards to each side of them.  The first creature was across the pond to the right side, and the second creature was on their side to their left.  The second creature was just beyond where they parked their car. Not knowing what it was that was screaming, they became afraid and decided to leave.  As they were rapidly trying to get to the car, a flock of ducks was flushed from the brush at the end of the pond where the first creature screamed from.  The ducks were very spooked.  The witnesses jumped into their car and began to head towards their trailer when two very frightened ducks rocketed through the timber between the pond and the road and one actually collided with the driver\\u2019s side mirror of their car. Second Encounter \\u2013 Eyes in the clear cut. Date: August 2nd Time: 12:00-1:00AM Moon: New Location: Up in the clear cut, near the logging equipment, which was parked about halfway between the road and the tree line along the right side of the spur road. Later that night, (after the encounter at the pond) they walked up the road into the clear-cut to check on the equipment.  They took a laser light pen with them.  After checking the equipment to make sure it was locked up, they were looking to see what might be out in the clear cut (like deer, elk, bear, etc.), when they saw three sets of red colored eyes close to the ground, in the open,  just to the left of the spur road.  The eyes moved from the left of the road up, onto the road.  When the witnesses shined the laser light on the creatures, the eyes seemed to bob and weave trying to duck away from the laser light. The creatures stayed close to the ground, with one set almost on the ground, and the other two higher up.  When the laser light hit the creatures, they could see hair about four inches long.  Then one set of eyes rose up to be about six feet above the road. They assumed it stood up.  Then all three creatures turned and walked away, up the spur road to the tree line. At the tree line, they turned left and headed down through the trees. The witnesses said that they could hear branches breaking as they walked. They could also hear vocalizations periodically. It sounded like two people who were very annoyed, and complaining. The screams were short vocalizations, like shouts, and were exactly the same as they heard near the pond. That ended the second encounter. Third Encounter - Whistling, Date: August 2nd Moon: New Time: Late afternoon to dusk Location: Halfway between the pond and their trailer, on the north side of the main-line road. The next day, the witnesses decided to take a walk.  It was late afternoon.  They walked from their trailer back towards the pond and then went up a cat road for a distance. They then turned around because it was getting dark. The boyfriend was getting an uneasy feeling about the situation. As they were walking out, they began to hear a flute like whistle.  When they would stop to listen, the whistle would stop.  When they started to walk again, the whistle would start up again.  What was making the whistling sound followed them all the way back to the main road.  They could not identify what was making the sound. Fourth Encounter \\u2013 The little one Date: August  6th Time: 11:30 PM Moon: \\u00bd full Location: At the creek which ran down from the clear cut and past the trailer. The female witness went to get water from the creek.  She was up in the clear cut a short distance, at a place on the creek where it was easy to fill up the water jugs.  She was crouching down filling up her water jugs when she looked up and saw two yellowish looking eyes framed by black, shiny skin.  She could see the eyes, nose, cheeks, and forehead.  It was five feet away,but down on the ground, looking up at her.  She said softly, \\u201cYou stay right there.\\u201d, and backed away.  She went to get her boyfriend.  When they came back a few minutes later the creature was gone. Fifth Encounter \\u2013 The big one Date: August  7th Time: Dusk, 10:00 PM Moon: A little more than \\u00bd full Location: In the clear cut, at the head of the little stream that flowed out of the clear cut and past the trailer. The next night, just at dusk, they could still see well enough to work on their car, which was having problems.  It was about 10:00 PM. There were big black bees that kept them inside the trailer during the day, so they went back out after the bees went away to work on the car. The female witness walked up the road leading into to clear cut to check on the logging equipment and make sure that the doors were all closed and locked.  Having done that, she was walking back towards the trailer, when she heard this \\u201csnorkeling sound\\u201d over by the creek.  She walked over to take a look at what might be there and saw this big, fur covered butt about 60-70 feet away. At first she thought it might be a bear or an elk.  It was on its knees, bending forward, drinking from the creek.  Then it stood up as if in slow motion.  She said that it looked like a big stump just growing out of the ground.  Then it stepped over a 3 foot high stump.  She said the creature was 8-9 feet tall, and moved like Andre the Giant stepping into a wrestling ring.  She said the hair was a burnt red color with gray tips.  She then ran in fear down towards the trailer, screaming as she ran. She stated that she didn\\u2019t know if it was chasing her or not, but she could hear it screaming also. Her boyfriend, hearing her, walked across the road to see what was going on. He said that the creature was moving away, screaming. He said that it threw a fit up in the trees.  It was yelling and screaming, breaking trees and branches.  The screaming was the same sound as they heard down by the pond. This was the first time they realized what they were encountering. Sixth Encounter \\u2013 Tree breaking Date: August 8th Time: Approximately midnight Moon: A little more than half full Location: 40 yards from the trailer. The same night they saw the big one in the clear cut, they went out to get water from the creek, but stayed close to the trailer, within 40 yards.  They wanted to be close enough to run to safety if necessary.  While getting water, they heard a creature walking in the woods close by.  The boyfriend threw some rocks in the direction of the sounds.  The creature reacted to the rock throwing by violently shaking a small tree.  It shook the tree so hard that it fell over.  This scared the witness, so he fired his one shot into the air to scare the creature away, and yelled, \\u201cStay away!\\u201d  At this, the creature went silent and walked away.  After the shot, the male creature made a call from above and behind them in the clear cut.  By this time, they could identify the two individuals by the sound of their voices.  The male makes a louder, deeper call.  The female voice is higher pitched, not as loud as the male, and has a distinctive short howling sound she makes at the end of her vocalizations. After the 5th and 6th encounters, they started walking in the woods during the day, looking for tracks. They found impressions in the moss which were quite large.  The interesting thing about the impressions is that there would be a deep heel print, then an undisturbed space, then the front of the foot.  The stride was 4 \\u00bd feet.  At one muddy bank, the found a track where the sasquatch tried to step up the bank, but it\\u2019s foot slipped and made a long five toed slide mark in the mud. They began to find stick structures in the shape of tripods and tee-pees.  There were large ones and very small ones.  The interesting thing is that the structures were made with the tips of the poles inserted into the ground and the root end up in the air.  They found lines of single poles stuck in the ground, tip end down, like trail markers. They found lean-to type structures made against a large tree, and there was what appeared to be a sleeping nest under it.  Inside they found hair, which looks like elk hair, and a full hand print.  The hand print was close to human proportions but dinner-plate large.  They found a log laying on the ground that had sticks arranged leaning on the log at even intervals. The couple constructed their own tee-pee near where they found the stick structures and the sleeping nest.  The idea was to make a structure as a blind, and then hide out in it at night to see what might show up.  They leaned poles up against the side of a big stump and lodged the lower ends into the stump roots.  Then they wove sticks horizontally.  They spent several hours that night inside this blind. After a few hours, with nothing happening, they decided to go back to the trailer.  They said, \\u201cI wonder what the sasquatches will think of our structure.\\u201d  As they were walking away, they heard one of the sasquatches hoot at them.  They were being watched the whole time.  The next day, they went back to check on their structure, and found it disassembled, and the sticks neatly stacked in three piles. Later, they decided to try to mimic the calls they were hearing.  They used a construction cone as a megaphone, and by making a call while sucking in air, the male witness was able to imitate the calls.  When he called, the creatures would almost always answer. This interaction continued intermittently until the end of August.  The creatures seemed curious about them and hung around at each of the three locations where they camped.  They would hear vocalizations from time to time. They said that it would be what they called the \\u201csquawk\\u201d call, and sometimes there would be wood-knocks or rock-clacking.  They heard both the male and female. The couple was stationed at the first logging site for about one month before being moved to the next logging site about a mile away. This move happened around the first of September. Second site. The couple stayed at the second site for about three weeks.  During this time, they would hear heavy, raspy, breathing from time to time as one of the creatures walked by their trailer.  There was a lot of human activity at this time.  The sasquatches curious about them, but left them alone. Third site. They stayed at the third site for two weeks. At this site, they explored the woods around the area.  They found stick structures, impressions, and the beds. The end.  The third week of September, they told the logging crew boss about what they had seen and experienced. He was not surprised, but said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t tell anybody!\\u201d.  He said that they were afraid that if it was proven that there really were sasquatches then the woods would be closed to logging. The next day, the witnesses were fired.  They were told that their services were no longer required.  This was supposed to be a six month job. Three days later, while they were in town, the logging company pulled their trailer out of the woods and left it by the highway.\", \"location_details\": \"Between the town of Morton and Riffe Lake.\", \"county\": \"Lewis County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 22475: Night watchmen at logging camp near Morton describes multiple incidents\", \"latitude\": 46.52352, \"longitude\": -122.3045, \"date\": \"2003-08-15\", \"number\": 22475.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c2308vke4s\", \"temperature_high\": 67.7, \"temperature_mid\": 60.745000000000005, \"temperature_low\": 53.79, \"dew_point\": 51.42, \"humidity\": 0.65, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.62, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0003, \"precip_probability\": 0.31, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1019.88, \"summary\": \"Overcast until evening.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 255.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.87, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.3045 46.52352)\"}, {\"observed\": \"possible vocalization? this happened when i was a sophomore going into junior year of high school. it was summer and me and about 10 of my friends went camping to the rainbow falls state park. they have alot of wildlife listed on their website to be known in the area, but none that would make a noise like the one me and one other friend can recall. after we put our fire out and people started going to sleep me and one other friend were the last to be up, we sitting on the picnic bench talking, about 5 minutes later we went in our tent where everyone else in our group was already asleep. we layed down and a couple minutes later i started to notice this high pitched howling noise way in the distance. at first i didnt think any thing at all of it, me and my friend who was awake were joking that it sounded almost like tires screeching way in the distance.

We left to go on a night hike and followed a trail down the river, very far down the river where we found a great dark spot in thick foliage to sit and have a beer and watch the stars and throw rocks into the river. As we were leaving we could here what sounded like something following us. We all had lights but could not see anything at all. When we made it back to camp we sat in a nearby clearing and watched the stars some more. The ladies who were at the camp reported someone throwing rocks near them and could here brush being moved around. They ignored it thinking that it was just us guys playing around. We headed back to the tents around 1am and went to bed. Before any of us were asleep that night we heard a screech or scream a few times. We all heard it.

The color of the hair made it almost impossible to see until it moved, as I said I couldnt figure out what was out of place till it began to move. After I gained composure, I went through my head so many times trying to explain what I had just seen. I have lived in the woods my whole life, hunted deer and elk since I was 12, Im now 32, I have seen every animal that roams the west side of the mountains, from bears to cougars, elk, deer, goats, and every other walking thing. This animal walked upright, on 2 legs, it never stopped, or looked. Just 2 steps and was gone. I  drove to my fathers house, about 1/4 mile away by road, and grabbed a couple flashlights, I was still shaking. We drove back to where I had seen it, and looked at the ground for tracks, or any kind of sign but found nothing.

I then said something like oh my god and then it blew its checks way up and muttered something wierd and i said something i can't remember. then it screamed very loud at me which made me scream if fear and then it turned and stepped up on a stump and jumped downhill. i floored the truck and went back to my son and his girlfriend about 1/2 to 3/4 mile away where i had left them to watch for deer. I was very scared and upset.  I waited to tell them but i was scaring them with how upset i was. so about an hour later i told them.

We started out exploring many of the roads in the area, and as we travelled down one road we encountered a tree that had fallen across the road but was lodged in the trees tops on the other side of the road. We were able to drive under it after we determined that it seemed safe from falling and blocking us in. We drove a short distance further and went through a sharp right turn and found another tree across the road the same way. So we decided to back up a few feet and take a smaller side road and turn around. Once we were on the side road we decide it may be a good road to check out, however we wanted to walk up the road to make sure we could turn around, or see if we could tell how far up it went. The road was smaller than the previous we were on, and neither of us had any previous knowledge of this area. After we got out of the jeep we walked about ten feet and heard a few quick knocks which sounded like a big stick hitting a tree, almost like someone knocking on a door. We continued walking and while talking about the noise, we then became distracted by some old broken equipment that was left by the loggers. We thought it was odd that it was left because it had some scap metal value. At that time we again heard the knock behind us, and on the same side of the road as before. At that point I took a couple of pictures toward the noise, but while looking at the display screen on the camera I was using (Canon PowerShot A720 IS) I did not see anything. As our attention was focused on that area and we moved closer, we heard another sound to the left of us also on the same side of the road. It was a massive snap that sounded like at least a 6 inch thick log breaking. It was not just a quick snap, we could hear the log snapping in sections like when you cut down a tree.

After being on-site without artificial illumination for over an hour, at 1 AM we still could not see our hands, legs, etc. If/when we observed/heard anything interesting we would signify that observation to the remote FLIR observation post by playing the song \\u201cJingle Bells\\u201d on the harmonica.  That song was only to be played when some form of contact was made. The two of us positioned ourselves roughly facing each other to facilitate a 360 degree field of view.  We talked about our plans for the upcoming hunting season, recapped some past events, joked, laughed and played various little ditties on our harmonicas. At approximately 1:00 am we heard the sound of a stick breaking a short distance directly behind my partner.  This was followed a few minutes later by two or three soft knocks, believed to coming from the same direction.  Approximately 20 \\u2013 30 minutes later my partner advised to look behind me. I initially turned to the right (saw nothing) then to the left and when tightly twisted around in my chair saw what appeared to be a floating red ball (with a slight tinge of orange).  The ball appeared to be in close proximity to the forest floor as it illuminated the ground in front (fan shaped pattern) with enough light to silhouette some ferns (estimated distance of ground illumination at 14-16 inches).  The ball moved slightly to the left and right and up and down (somewhat akin to a sniffing motion) then we saw what appeared to be a large index finger, again silhouetted by the light emanating from the source..  My partner started playing Jingle Bells (with some vigor) and I attempted to talk to the red ball in reassuring/comforting tones.  My partner made it about half way through another song (neither of us can recall which one) before the red ball gradually dimmed and went out.  We also observed what appeared to be the finger tip, and the first and second knuckles.  The \\u201cfinger\\u201d moved slowly in our direction and toward the forest floor prior to the light source fading out. The two of us remained in the dark and marveled at whatever it was that we had just experienced and wished that the two men in the remote outpost had either been with us to see same or had some form of experience on their own.

At the time I was about 32 years of age and had heard of sasquatch or bigfoot but had never had any thoughts about them. A co-worker (Don W.) and myself had been performing some work for the National Park Service in the State of Washington during the summer of 1978 or 1979.  We had made other trips to the region prior this this trip, but this trip will always stand out in my mind. On a weekend outing Don and I had decided to do some trout fishing on the Olympic Peninsula.  A Seattle motel owner suggested we try fishing the Hamma Hamma River as it did not get the fishing pressure or the commercial gill netting pressures more common on the famous streams that empty on the west side of the pennsula.  Following his suggestion, we came to a tiny picnic area and unloaded our gear.  Don went downstream and I headed upstream.  By mid-afternoon I was perhaps a mile upstream and had caught several trout.  I was totally alone and concentrating on fishing when out of the corner of my right eye I noticed movement about 10 feet in the air, followed by a tremendous splash about 30 feet to my right in the stream.  Shocked, I found myself looking at very large boulder close to 3 feet long and maybe 2.5 feet thick that wasn't there a few moments before.  I turned around thinking it had rolled off a steep bank, but I was nowhere near anything it could have rolled off of, as I was fishing in a meadow-like area.  At that moment I had a very uneasy feeling come over me, and a feeling that I was not alone.  About 30 feet behind me quantities of tall dead grass filled the bank, and I remember not wanting to look to closely.  I grabbed my fish and headed back to the car at a pretty quick pace. I did not see anything, nor did I smell anything.  I distinctly remember not wanting to see anything that could throw a 300 pound rock over 30 feet. When I arrived back at the car, Don had already arrived ahead of me and I told him what happened.  He laughed and made a wise crack about it, and said let's eat some of these fish.  We made a fire in the stove provided at the campsite, ate our fish and left.  That's about all there is to say concerning the incident.  Over the years, I've often thought about what happened and I still can't come up with any possible way that boulder could have landed where it did, without someone or something throwing it.  I've never seen anyone powerful enough to pickup a boulder that size let alone throw it a considerable distance.  I also regret not having the nerve to investigate the area a little more, but I felt very vulnerable at that moment in time.\", \"location_details\": \"The incident occurred so many years ago, I'm sorry but I just can't remember the exact path of travel we used to get there.

I even thought about submitting it onto this site but I did not bother because it happened on an island(and I thought it was crazy).  When I read about the report(on this site) on Hartstene Island, my skin crawled and I decided that I had better do this.  I grew up on Hartstene Island. In 1984 my parents used to sell Xmas trees down in California, and I would stay at home alone for about three weeks. I was a junior in high school.  My older brother and his wife lived across the street, so I was never really THAT isolated.  We lived in a big house on a farm in an old fruit orchard,  with horses chickens and pigs.  Abby, our German Shephard was always around although sometimes she would dissappear at night, and I am sure that she was not at home with me the night that this happened because her barking would have woke me up.  And she sometimes used to go crazy barking at night, but we always dismissed it as deer, and sometimes you could hear twigs snapping out in the woods behind our house.  The woods behind our house went on for quite a ways......they had been logged off previously and so it was second or third growth that went way back, with no houses during that time. My parents were in California selling trees.  Our house was a big one story with lots of windows.  I always felt like I was being watched at night so I would go around and pull most of the curtains shut.  Beyond the yard light it was pitch black.  Our house was shaped like a T at that time and my bedroom was on the end left side of the T with the  kitchen being kind of in the top middle of the T.  There was a slider that opened from the kitchen out onto a covered deck.  The deck had two gates, and one of them opened up about two feet from the end of one of my bedroom windows, the bottom of which was about  five feet off of the ground.  I had gone to sleep and at about 230 AM I suddenly jerked awake for no reason and looked at the bedroom window that was on the right side of my bed.  Something black was outlined and all I could really see was a head, like it was trying to peer into the window as opposed to just standing there right in front of it.  Anyhow, it seemed at the time I saw it, whatever it was realized that I saw it and it took off running off of the porch, in the process making some clattering noise(clattering noises on wood) as it knocked something over.  At the time, I thought it could have been deer hooves, but why would a deer be on our porch leaned over the fence and looking in my window?  It ran off of the porch so fast then, right around my end of the house, which meant that I heard it running through the side yard by my room and then through the back yard.  It was incredibly fast and I could hear it crashing through the woods loudly.  It was so fast that I honestly cannot remember if it sounded like it was bipedal or not.  But I seriously doubt that a deer would stand up against the side of a house to look into a window at night, that does not make sense to me. Instinctively I felt like it was some sort of animal I had never seen beofre and not human. I was so scared that I closed my eyes and prayed because I could not understand why a deer would do that, and I thought it was a person but it ran way too fast. And I  was really creeped out that someone would take off running through the woods at the back of our house at 230 AM when they could have just ran back down the driveway.....    Needless to say, I stayed at my brothers house for most nights from that night until my parents came home.\", \"location_details\": \"its the house across from my brothers house, whish is(edited) drive, or (edited) drive, however the house has been sold since then, but I would be glad to show you where it is\", \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 9168.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"When I was 16, I was at my parents' cabin near the Olympic National Park (Lake Kokanee).  My friend Sean and I went down to the rope swing which was about 200 yards down hill from the house.  We had decided to call it a day and were putting our shoes and shirts on for the short hike back up the hill.  As we got ready to go, we could hear something approaching from the north of us.  This all happened in a short period of time but it seemed like an eternity.  Immediately we could tell it was on two feet; assuming that it was a person, I thought they were jumping from foot to foot.  The strides were very far apart.  I called out twice (who's there?  who's there?).  There was no reply.  As it got closer I could hear branches breaking underfoot.  Looking back, this thing was very large.  The brush there is very dense, on the side of the hill, so we could not see what was coming.  When it was no more than 40 yards away I could see it.  It swept back a vine maple, and looked at us like it was surprised.  It's very hard to explain but it looked like a person in a way.  It was not as tall as I had heard that they were, maybe 7'0\\\" at the most.  It had very wide shoulders, and was very muscular.  I did not smell a foul odor.  Its face did look somewhat human - I think it's the way it looked at us.  Anyway, almost as soon as we had seen it, we both turned and ran up the hill, grabbing branches to pull our way up.

The pond is very secluded and one side, the side across from us was steep bank with thickvegetation. While we sat at the edge of the pond we heard loud brush movement followed y a loud crack as from a large limb breaking. We watched the other side of the pond hoping to see what was making so much noise. Our thoughts were a large animal with as much weight as a bear or elk etc. As we sat, from time to time there would be more rustling of brush followed by the loud crack of a limb breaking but whatever was there never showed itself or left. I sat there for 30 - 45 min. My husband growing bored began working his way around the pond. About half way around he began smelling a strong unpleasant odor. We both felt a strong unease. He came back and we left.

I was comeing up to the grange hall turn where there is a connecting road that travels south on the eastern side of the Island. There is a hill at the point of the intersection and I slowed down to the recommended speed because there is a hairpin turn just down the other side. As my light's came over the top of the hill I could see into the large pasture next to the road where it turned left. It was a clear fall night and the moon was out so I could see very good. I noticed something standing in the field couldn't remember seeing it before. I thought it was a tree stump at first but there wasn't one there before. Then I thought about the horses that are usually there in the daytime but it just wasn't it. I was slowing down to about 10-15 mph so I could turn left when this thing turned it's head and looked straight at me. I remember quickly slowing the car and almost came to a stop. As I rolled through the corner it turned in the same direction and walked at the same speed I was rolling. It was absolutely HUGE! It wasn't very far from my car maybe 40ft. The field is about 3-4 ft below the road and this thing towered over me so I had to look over the top of the steering wheel to see it. I could smell it and it burned my nose. My window's were up but the heater was on. It took long stride's and was actually moving faster than me and I stopped the car because I thought it was going to come over the barbed wire fence into the road in front of me.

At the corner of the fenceline the road turn's sharply to the right and it just stepped over the fence with no trouble at all. I remember feeling scared to death and the hair on my body was standing up. It crossed the road at the corner and disapeared on the other side in the brush.

It was perfect noise monitoring conditions, clear night with no winds at all (extremely quiet).  Right when I started my measurement I heard coyotes from the direction of the driveway, off in the distance.  A few dogs in the distance barked at the howls.  I then heard some different animals.  I heard 2 or 3 screams from one location and a single scream in response from further north.  These screams seemed to be communicating to each other.  It lasted about 30 seconds or so.  The dogs in the distance continued to bark, although the 2 dogs in the yard with me did not. I was really wondering what animal it could have been.  I would describe coyote howls as an owwwoooooooo noise.  These screams started as a howl but ended in a scream, like ooooaaaahhhcchhh.   The ending part sounded like a woman screaming, but the scream was solid-sounding and not screechy.  It sounded about a half-mile away but still very loud and clear. Now maybe you can tell me...  It could have been mountain lions, but I am not sure if those animals are 'group' animals.  Maybe it was a mother and her cubs trying to find each other.

I think the sound of the log hitting the tree was about 3 times, whack, whack, whack. Soon after we heard the same sound coming from about 100 yards away from the first one, and the same distance from us. The area that the noises were coming from were on the same side of the stream that we had come from our vehicle from. I looked at my friend and said, \\\"what was that?\\\" He replied that he didn't know. My friend has been hunting all over western Washington since he was nine years old,  and is very familiar with the wild life here and the noises they make, I might add. We didn't think much of it when a few minutes went by and we heard the most eerie growling roar I have ever heard. I really don't know how to describe it, but whatever made that sound was not being as close to as loud as it could have been, and the sound still went right through me. I could feel it in my chest. I was more terrified than I had ever been in my life and I ran to my friend upstream. I don't know which one of us did it first, but we both ended up putting our hands up over our heads and yelling trying to dissuade whatever it was from coming after us. I was more scared than I had ever been. We got out of the creek at this point, and grabbing some rocks headed back to the truck through the woods. I was bringing up the rear and keeping watch as we went. I was much calmer walking back. On the way back we were even joking around about it. Back at the truck I asked my friend what he thought it was. He said he didn't know, but he knew it wasn't a bear, cougar, elk or anything else he'd ever heard before. I never made a report of it before because I just never thought of it before until reading some similar stories on your site. I believe that whatever we heard that day was a sasquatch.

I am a Mason County resident that has lived here in Shelton for most of my life.My father was a State Fire Warden since the late 1950's up until his retirement in 1978,and my Mother was a floral greens harvester for about 50 years.Consiquently I know this area better than most residents as I also run a business that requires me to be in the woods a lot.I was employed by the USFS from 1970 to 1983 in Fire Management. My first encounter with what I believe to be a Sasquatch was in  October,1984.I was living in Oregon at the time and had came home to visit my folks who resided on the Cloqullam road about 3 miles west of Shelton.One evening as I was sleeping on their couch I heard a screaming noise off in the distance(I am estimating a 1/4 mile)that I can only describe as a cross between a donkey braying,a high pitched scream and a growling noise at the end.What amazed me most was the duration of this howling as it lasted about 15 seconds.About 5 minutes later it howled again, this time much closer to the house and repeats itself twice.I can still recall my parents watchdogs scratching at the door to get in.As the noise got closer I could hear a more distant but unquestionably return answer to the screaming. The thing finally got to within a couple hundred yards of the house and the noise was like an air raid siren.I have never heard any animal as loud as this.It screamed a couple of more times and then it headed back the way it came continuing to scream at intervals until it was a very distant noise and either was out of my range of hearing or had quit.The next morning I asked my parents if they had heard the noise from the previous night.They answered yes and told me that they had been hearing it for years. I did a little checking around the area and found an elderly couple who with a little urging told me of there encounter about a year before that.The couple lived about a mile from my parents place and were in the habit of taking an evening walk up a pipeline which runs betwwen their place and my parents.One evening'as they put it,something tall,large,and hairy walked from the brush across in front of them into the timber on the other side of the pipeline.It walked on two legs,and was not in a hurry but took long strides and crossed the pipeline in about 5 strides.They said it was about 50 yards in front of them and had a very bad odor. Other people in the area attested to hearing the noises.As a prologue to this about 3 weeks later my parent's dog came up missing and I found him on the pipeline.His neck was broken and he was severly torn up.I don't know if this had any thing to do with the noise but I have always wondered. My other encounter was in early fall of 1996.I was out with my dog checking on some leases I had with Simpson Timber Company.After my business was finished I stopped at an area I knew I could find some mushrooms to take home.This is in an area near the Satsop River and betwwen the Cloqullam road and the Matlock-Brady road.It was late afternoon around 5:30 pm and I only had about an hour of light left. My dog and I hiked a short way in from the road and I was down on my hands and knees cutting mushrooms when my dog came over to me and tried to get as close as he could.I was mad at him because he was stepping on the mushrooms.I recall getting a whiff of very putrid smelling air.The smell was overpowering almost like something had died with an overtone of rotting garbage.I stood up to see where the smell was comming from and turned to my right and in doing so saw a large hairy creature standing in a fern patch about 200 feet away.We both made eye contact about the same time and I was so startled for a few seconds I had to rationlize what I was seeing. It stood a good 3 to 4 feet above the ferns and was very dark(although it was late, and this could have made it seem darker in color)It turned its head to look back and then turned its torso and arms and as it did I could see long hair on its arms.It proceeded to walk quickly away.I proceeded to walk out and come home.I didn't tell anyone for a couple of days as I kept going over it in my head to ensure myself that this it what I actually saw and I am positive of the events. I have since then found tracks in the same area which is only about 8 miles as the crow flys from my parents house.\", \"location_details\": \"Contact me\", \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 7580: Man shares encounters of an unknown subject\", \"latitude\": 47.2293, \"longitude\": -123.4898, \"date\": \"2004-11-16\", \"number\": 7580.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c22htvv6x5\", \"temperature_high\": 49.42, \"temperature_mid\": 41.435, \"temperature_low\": 33.45, \"dew_point\": 43.18, \"humidity\": 0.95, \"cloud_cover\": 0.77, \"moon_phase\": 0.16, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0035, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1022.03, \"summary\": \"Light rain in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 1.0, \"visibility\": 5.97, \"wind_bearing\": 205.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.96, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.4898 47.2293)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Myself and my cousin were driving to Jarrel Cove on Hartstene Island for a 2 day fishing trip.

We spoke with the witness for over an hour, then recorded his full account.  Here is the transcript of the interview. The blurry cellphone photos are shown below the interview, in the Investigator Comments section. These images do not have enough clarity to show details of the figure, but they do show its approximate size, girth, posture and color. --------------------------------- BFRO Investigator: What were the events that led up to this incident? Witness: We came down the road and turned around like usual and we go very slow down the end of the road. As we come down this road, probably at about 150 yards, maybe a little more out in the woods I could see something moving. I didn't know what it was and we went past a few trees and I ask the boy \\u201cWHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT?\\u201d He couldn't see it, and I drove ahead about another five feet. Stopped the truck and you could see a form coming. I call it a sasquatch. It kept coming. I said \\u201cLook at that!\\u201d He said \\u201cWhat is that??\\u201d \\u201cWell I don't know what the hell it is and I don't even have my camera.\\u201d Then he said \\u201cYou do too have a camera \\u2013 you\\u2019ve got your cellphone.\\u201d So I took the phone out and handed it to him. By the time he got the phone working that was when picture 1 was taken. It was about that time that it was fifty yards from us.  Then the next picture it was probably thirty yards, for picture 2, and then it turned to its left. BFRO Investigator: Was it aware of you at that point? Witness: It didn't act like it cared if we were there or not, other than it did turn. It was getting brushier between us and it and it turned, then went into an opening.  It came into the opening and then at one point it stopped and turned its head, looking right at us. Investigator: Did it turn its head or whole body? Witness: Well, the whole shoulder part - the front portion. It lifted its left shoulder back and twisted and looked at us. Then it just went right back into the angle it was. Investigator: When it looked at you, what was the expression on its face? Could you see any of that? Witness: I don't know.  It just looked at us. You know \\u2013 deer-in-the-headlights type of look. Investigator: Did it look surprised? Witness: It looked more like the same as we were, \\u201cWhat are you?  What the heck are you doing here?\\u201d   I was just looking at the size of it cause it was ... IT WAS HUGE. I kept asking him, \\u201cDID YOU GET A PICTURE???\\u201d You know, \\u201cDid you get a picture???\\u201d (Witness's son).. \\u201cI GOT A PICTURE THERE!\\u201d Then it just turned back and to the angle it was originally going. Then it picked up its stride. It moved a little faster probably half again as fast as it was going. Then he (the witness\\u2019s son) got out of the truck, the boy did. Then it paused, like it was going to turn again and look at us but it didn't. It just turned, I don't know if it went around something or what and he got one more picture. Then it came on the road and he couldn't get one more picture before he left. I don't know how long all that took. Investigator: So it cut across a logging road? Witness: The road runs through there. Investigator: And you lost it once it went across? Witness: It stepped right on the road and I don't think it made two steps.  The first step and then it was standing, stopped right there and it looked right at us. It was standing more upright. The next step it went into heavy brush - just a deer trail or a little path. The brush just closed in around it. I pulled forward and there is another little road that goes down along the way it went and we never did see it again. Investigator: You said it crossed the road, how many steps did it take to cross the road? Witness: One, two it was across because it just stepped in the road and stepped off it. It's a narrow road. It's just a regular Ford pickup so it's the width of the pickup, brush rubs both sides of the truck so eight or nine feet. Like when deer will jump, hit the road once when they are running. It had the same stride as a deer would running - you know jumping through the woods. Investigator: Was there a trail on either side of the road? Witness: I didn't notice a trail where it came from as much as I noticed a trail from where it went. You know where it came from was bracken fern and salal brush. It's up there above my waist. Back here where it came, turned originally in the opening - there was water even then, probably it's a low spot kinda where it came through probably a foot deep or two feet deep from the rains. Investigator: So would you estimate about 48 inches tall for the fern and the salal? Witness: About that tall.  Then it goes in stages but your base layer is at least that high. Investigator: So what we are seeing in these pictures is... ? Witness: Oh his butt was above the brush, it's chest height on me. [the witness is 6 feet tall] Investigator: From that picture it appears the figure is down on all fours. Witness: Don't think so, I don't think the hands were on the ground. Investigator: You don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s walking with its knuckles? Witness: Everything else moved but the arms didn't.   They were just kind of there. Investigator: So you didn't see any big arm movement, like when a gorilla walks quadrupedally? Witness: I didn't see the arms moving at all. Investigator: So it is walking hunched over but not down on all fours? Witness: I didn't notice it being down on all fours. Investigator: Just looking at the angle the torso is in, leaning quite far forward - it would be very difficult to walk in that manner without falling over. Witness: Well I couldn\\u2019t do it.. Laugh.. Investigator: Yeah, that is interesting. Witness: I said it's not like he's crawling over logs or windfalls or anything either. He appears to be more hunched over in certain pictures than when he was walking towards us, but he was still hunched over coming towards us. I noticed as he was coming towards us that he walked from side to side. Investigator: He waddled? Witness: Yeah he swayed or something, like every step he would really make a big step,...you know like a little kid being proud or something... but I know, well you just need better pictures, you need to be there.. Investigator: You needed your video camera. Witness: [Laughing] Yeah - I wouldn't have had these if the kid hadn't remembered the camera on the phone. Investigator: So did you try to look for any impressions or footprints? Witness: No actually, I can say no, I didn't.  The road is pretty hard.   It's all black crushed rock and that's hard as rock. There is nothing there where he came out of.  He didn\\u2019t leave as much of a trail as I thought he would coming through the bracken ferns and stuff. That's what I thought. It surprised me, because after he came through there I figured you'd see a trail, as even brush pickers and mushroom pickers coming through you can see they're leaving trails. You know breaking them away, and there wasn't one. It was hard to see where he came out on to the road vs where he went in. He went in on a regular old deer trail & where he came out, it was almost undisturbed. That surprised me as a matter of fact. Places I went in there I left more of a trail in the bracken ferns than he did. Investigator: What time of day was this? Witness: It had to be around 10:00, 10:30. Investigator: In the morning? Witness: Yeah Investigator: And it's on the 16th of November (2007). Witness: Yeah a week ago Friday Investigator: There weren't any other cars around? Witness: No, there was nobody else there. Not where we were at.

We did not feel threatened or scared at the time. The sounds were deep. Something between a roar and screem. They had a very deep growly under tone. In between sounds my husband was disagreeing with me. He suggested it was an elk or coyote. Our dogs both became clingy and started whining, so I had to bring them inside so we could hear.

The sounds were deep but some of them changed pitch going even lower midway through. What ever was making the sounds had much larger lung capacity that even a big man.

My dog growled and flipped himself over & broke the tent pole. He was very agitated, nervous and couldn't calm down. The whoop sounded longing, lonely or lost in tone.  It was definatly a female tone, the whoops went \\\"whooop whooop whoop, whoop whoooop..\\\" then would stop for about 15-20min, then again \\\"whooop whoooop....\\\" on and on for about 2.5 - 3hrs.  The noise came from up above the campsite away from the Lake.  It sounded really close but could tell it was far away, perhaps about 1- 2 blocks away.  It was difficult to tell due to the woods, lake and projection of the very loud voice.  I thought it could be an owl but no owl sounds like that, then I thought maybe an Elk but once again I've never heard an elk like this before. I couldn't go to sleep that night due to my dog wouldn't calm down, he was on alert all night until it finally stopped. I was petrified and was up all night wondering if this creature making the noise was coming to visit us in our tents.

It was totally silent -- which it normally is around here at night -- and as I sat there on the wooden steps, with Icy sitting on the deck about 3 feet away from me, I heard what at first sounded like a distant siren, seemingly\\u00a0from the north-north-east. (The only thing in that direction from\\u00a0our house is Dow Mountain, with no roads except for dirt logging roads).  Icy's response to sirens is invariably the same: he lifts up his head, pricks his ears, listens intently, and then begins\\u00a0howling, usually in the moment\\u00a0just after the siren becomes inaudible to my human ears.\\u00a0That night, though, his response was completely different. He came quickly to my side and pressed himself against me, sort of hunching himself into\\u00a0an extension of my body. As I listened, I viscerally \\\"knew\\\" that what I was hearing was NOT a siren, although it did seem\\u00a0very, very similar to a siren sound. \\u00a0I remember I was holding my breath -- and my impression was that I didn't start breathing again until the sound had completely stopped -- and I can only hold my breath for about 50 seconds, so that's the amount of time I would guess the sound went on.  The same instinct that told me that I was not listening to a siren also told me that\\u00a0I had never heard this sound before.\\u00a0 Another -- to me -- validating aspect was that my own response to it was out of character, just as Icy's was. Normally I would have sat there for another hour or so, hoping to hear it again.\\u00a0It was so amazing -- and I usually can't get enough of that kind of interesting mysterious stuff. But when the howling ended and I started breathing again, my first impulse was to get inside the house, quietly and fast.  I went online and Googled every kind of indigenous Pacific Northwest animal I could think of: elk, fox, coyote, deer, bear, rabbit, moose, cougar,\\u00a0various owls, other birds -- even wolf, which we purportedly do not have in this area -- and couldn't find any WAV file that\\u00a0even came close.\\u00a0On a chance, I looked up Sasquatch WAV files, and listened to the ones that I could find --\\u00a0I think there were five -- and one of them, the \\\"Ohio\\u00a0Howl\\\", was a dead ringer.\\u00a0When I heard it coming through the headphones, chills started running up my back.\\u00a0That was the sound I'd heard.\", \"location_details\": \"Approximately 300 feet from Highway 119, and approximately 1.5 miles northwest of the Foothills Park area.\", \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 28487: Possible vocalization heard near Lake Cushman and Dow Mountain\", \"latitude\": 47.41995, \"longitude\": -123.2005, \"date\": \"2011-01-11\", \"number\": 28487.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c22mu881hr\", \"temperature_high\": 33.99, \"temperature_mid\": 31.925, \"temperature_low\": 29.86, \"dew_point\": 24.42, \"humidity\": 0.81, \"cloud_cover\": 0.43, \"moon_phase\": 0.23, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0008, \"precip_probability\": 0.37, \"precip_type\": \"snow\", \"pressure\": 1020.38, \"summary\": \"Foggy starting in the evening.\", \"uv_index\": 1.0, \"visibility\": 7.96, \"wind_bearing\": 35.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.28, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.2005 47.41995)\"}, {\"observed\": \"On Friday the 5th of November 2010, my family and I decided to go hiking near Lake Cushman. I typically go hiking alone as it gives me opportunity to gather my thoughts and enjoy the outdoors. Seeing as how my wife\\u2019s birthday was coming up she managed to convince me to take her and our two children along. I had planned a more arduous hike near Mt. St. Helens but given the children\\u2019s notable lack of ambition and current weather conditions I elected to drive the hour and a half from our home in Castle Rock to Lake Cushman for a more \\u201cfamily friendly\\u201d outdoor experience.  We arrived at the Big Creek trail near Hoodsport at around 1000 hours and began our hike (trail 827.1 loop). It was a cool day with a light drizzle and visibility was at times no more than 75-100 yards. The hike was rather uneventful and my wife and I both noted that the utter silence of the forest that day was deafening. There was one other car at the entrance to the park so I just assumed they had gone in ahead of us on the same path and had ruined our chances of viewing any wildlife. At around 1130 hours I heard a truck about 75 yards up the ridge. I looked up just in time to see the cab lights of a logging truck heading up the mountain on road 2419. About 10 to 15 minutes later I heard what I initially thought was another vehicle struggling to climb the road. A couple of seconds later I realized it wasn\\u2019t a car at all but an animal or possibly another person. It sounded like part howl and part groan. It was difficult to describe other than to say it seemed mournful. This groan/howl lasted about 8-10 seconds during which time I turned to look at my wife and children. The look on their faces said it all. They had heard it as well. Almost simultaneously everyone said \\u201cwhat was that\\u201d. I said I had no idea and we continued on. At around 1200 hours we approached the Skinwood Creek Bridge. All at once we were stopped dead in our tracks by a horrible odor, which I can only describe as a cross between skunk and ammonia. The odor was so heavy we could taste it and our eyes even began to water a bit. My daughter began to cry and repeatedly begged me to let us return to the truck. I must confess I would have liked to oblige but we were at the half way point and continuing forward seemed to be the most logical course of action. As we continued on the odor dissipated. We made the turn at the bridge and started back down the trail on the west side. At almost the same point we encountered the odor on the east side of the trail we picked up the scent again on the west side. We continued down the trail and once again the odor dissipated. The remainder of the hike was uneventful and I dare say we made much better time heading back to the truck.\", \"location_details\": \"Olympic National Forest just East of the Mount Skokomish Wilderness on Big Creek Trail 827.1\", \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 28485: Possible daytime encounter by a family hiking near Lake Cushman\", \"latitude\": 47.29435, \"longitude\": -123.1267, \"date\": \"2011-01-25\", \"number\": 28485.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c22mn1tvec\", \"temperature_high\": 47.93, \"temperature_mid\": 43.045, \"temperature_low\": 38.16, \"dew_point\": 43.15, \"humidity\": 0.94, \"cloud_cover\": 0.88, \"moon_phase\": 0.72, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1027.17, \"summary\": \"Foggy overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 1.0, \"visibility\": 8.9, \"wind_bearing\": 203.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.55, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.1267 47.29435)\"}, {\"observed\": \"January 15, 2014 approximately 5:30 pm.

The first call I didn't quite pay attention to, however the second call made my hair stand on end, and it was close (I would guesstimate within 100 yards). It was dark and because of the fire all I could see in that direction was darkness but I felt that I was being watched and possibly being called to.

Our family would buy beef from my uncle on a yearly basis since I was a year old so I knew the ranch and the acreage pretty well. The ranch has since been sold and is dilapidated, but there are people living there. The ranch is located just west of Moses Mountain and incorporates Moses Meadows as part of the ranch. My first encounter of which I had no idea what I had seen was when my brother and I were at the \\\"log playhouse\\\", just east of the main ranch house. While we were acting like cowboys, I was at the west side of the log playhouse, and seen what I thought was a bear, just the back mind you, going over a slight ridge in the road, which, I believe was about 50 yards away, I yelled bear and we both took of to the ranch house located about 50 yards to the west. We both told our great uncle about what we had seen. Well my uncle went to investigate, when he came back he spoke to my uncle and my uncle and him went to see what he had seen. When they both returned they \\\"privately\\\" spoke in the meat cutting room of the ranch house, after which my great uncle suggested we stay inside for the evening and play games or whatever, he didn't even allow me or my brother to go with him to feed cattle that evening like we always did with him. Later the next year I had heard through my mom and dad that my uncle had seen some huge \\\"foot prints\\\" by the road when he investigated my bear sighting. Remember I have been riding horse, fishing and exploring this ranch for nearly 14 years by this time. When I was old enough (15 years old) I had asked my great uncle if I could work there for the summer, (1977) since I was of age at that time for ranch work he was more than welcoming. At the time he had 2 other hands there besides me. One time I, and another ranch hand, went up Moses mountain when my great uncle and aunt went to a party or something and wanted to get some rabbits or grouse we had been traveling for a bit when the ranch hand shot a huge rabbit, we gathered it in his truck and proceeded up Moses Mountain, he then shot a grouse on the left side of the road at that moment I caught a glimpse of the back of what I thought was a bear out of the right, at the same time he looked over at me after shooting the grouse and his eyes widened like a guy being electrocuted, mind you this is a 2 lane dirt road uphill, he turned that old willys around in short order and hauled ass, and I kept asking WTF what are you doing?. When my great uncle and aunt returned he told them what he had seen and my great uncle was very inquisitive on what he had seen and where he had seen it. I was in AWE, We all headed up to Moses Mountain, my great uncle insisted everyone stay in the truck when we arrived where the ranch hand said he saw something. After my great uncle searched the area (rifle in hand) he asked that anyone who needed to go outside, in daylight or dark to take someone with them, then we all headed back to the ranch.I need to bounce back a bit in time, my great uncle was a great coyote caller, he could call them in to 30 feet of where he was standing, back when I was a boy (5 years to 14 years old) he would call them off the porch of the ranch house, and then you could hear them from Moses Meadows, they would get closer, he would howl, and they would get closer yet. As I am telling this memory other things come to mind so bear with me. One time in particular my uncle did his howling (1973 or so) and a low tone howl, followed by a sort of sharp type up ooooooppppp followed, my dad said jokingly, \\\" sounds like a coyote with a calf in its mouth\\\", my uncle then grabbed a rifle and headed to Moses Meadows, about a mile away, he said he was going alone! no shots were fired and my great uncle came back to the ranch house. October 1974 I will never forget this, my great uncle is doing coyote calls from the front porch, my dad, brother, mom and aunt are laughing at the variety of calls being made back to my uncle. When all of a sudden a very loud and definitive type howl comes from the back of the ranch house, definitely not coyotes, followed by 3 huge grunts, the fence is 100 feet from the back of the ranch house, not much of a fence, but that was my judgement of distance. My great uncles eyes went totally wide and white, then both my aunt and great uncle said they would like us inside. 1977, summer, July. So I began working on my great uncles ranch, we all went to Bill's Hill directly behind the ranch to fix fence, at about noon that day, just after lunch while I was pounding in a fence post I looked up to ask my great uncle a question and I seen 2 trees, pine trees, that were at least 20 feet tall sway, I was looking I believe east and he west, the trees were 20 feet inside the fence line to the south, at the same time my uncle had evidently seen the swaying trees and came directly to me and stopped. Once there he said, \\\"you have to ranch with them, and live with them, they mean no harm, just leave when they ask and come back and finish your work\\\", at that time we both heard a uuggh ugghh (loud, like someone yelling), the tree to the right of the fence line moved a lot, 20 foot tree bent or swayed nearly 75 degrees, then crashing through the woods, you could actually see where an animal was moving, a large animal, these trees and the brush on Bills Hill at the time were very close, and the brush was very dense, I challenge anyone to copy that.

She told me that she thought she had just seen a Bigfoot and she showed me where, by pointing to a spot on the hillside where they saw this \\u2018thing.\\u2019 While she was describing what she had seen and where it had come from, this creature stood up behind a bush about 75 yards from us.  The creature just stared at us for a moment before turning and darting into the woods. At this point, many in the campground had joined us, including my wife, who brought the camcorder out of our camper. I told my wife to turn the camcorder \\u2018on\\u2019 and scan the woods on the hillside, thinking that it might show itself again. About 2 to 3 minutes later, it appeared another 100 yards up the side of the mountain, which was very steep and rugged terrain. The creature then proceeded to run across the hillside, between openings in the trees, jump a ravine and continued behind a knoll where it started walking.   As it approached the tree line, its upper body came back into view. My wife recorded about 22 seconds of footage of the overall sighting. I spent several more days there, doing additional research and recording, such as attempting to trace its path, compare my stride to the creature\\u2019s, and so on. I have some very interesting video footage of this support data, including what I thought were resting beds underneath some of the trees. Also, my tape has a howl on it as the creature had left our sight.

There was 3 feet on the ground in places and temp. was 15 below 0. I asked a friend who logged in Idaho for years if he ever had the hair on the back of head stand up while in the woods.

We decided to camp at the Loup Loup pass campground which is located between the towns of Twisp and Brewster in Chelan County. It was an evening that a mild rain would occur and clear off for a short time followed by another mimor storm cell. We arrived at this campground in the mid/late afternoon. The campground had three levels at that time. The upper level was the largest and was on a large flat field. The second level was a bench with a few sites and the third and bottom level was the most remote and bordered a small creek that flowed south east. This creek bottom had very heavy brush. We picked a campsite that was away from the creek and away from the majority of mosquitos and was at the base of the middle bench level of the campground. We pitched our tent and started preparing dinner. At the time we drove in we were the only ones in the campground. Shortly before dusk we heard the first call. As we recall it was a multi-tone report that consisted of high pitched as well as deep guttural roar. I have hunted for years and this was of nothing I had heard in the past. This was not an elk, bear or cougar. At the first call our normally quiet and lethargic dog was excited and aggitated. I took him and my 45 up to the top level as the call came from our E and sounded as if it were on the top level. I got to the top within a few minutes and found nothing. There were no other campers at that time either. We were unsure of the sound but knew it was foriegn to us and was very substantial in depth and volume. After discussing our situation we decided to stay as it was well after dark. All was quiet for maybe an hr. or so then it sounded off again. Ths time it was to the S. and on our level in the brush along the creek. We decided at that point to spend the night in the car. I am unsure of the exact timing of the calls but it seems that the next one was maybe 1/2-1 hr. later. The following one was maybe  1//2- 1 hr. apart as well but the call was moving to our west and north and was moving up the creek drainage. After the third call we heard a distant call similiar to the one near us. After the close caller sounded off, the distant one did also. It appeared that the two callers were locating and moving toward each other. This went on throught the night until the two were quite close and then the calling ceased. As day broke we saw nothing. I was too cautious to enter the heavy brush in search of tracks but in retrospect I wish I had. We broke camp and left. As we were leaving we found a couple of motor homes that had camped in the first few spaces on the main level and asked them when they had come in and if they had heard anything unusual. They stated that they came in late and heard nothing. They were near the distant edge of the first level. This sound was nothing that my wife and I had ever heard before or since.

We stay near Falls Creek and not in a camp ground, but up in the hills.  The nearest hunter to us is probably 5 miles away.  It is always a good time. In October of 2005, this last hunting season, we had a stange experience.  My friend and I were walking down an old logging landing down to a creek bottom.  We were talking and weren't being very quiet.  When we got to within 50 yards of the creek, we began to here rocks being smashed together repeatedly. The sound was definitely rocks being slammed together, and it was loud.  We figured it was right in front of us about 50-75 yards away.  Our first thought was if it wasn't a man how could a bear slam rocks.  We figured they would roll them over to look for food or something and wouldn't be able to hold them and slam them together at some points 4-5 times in row. There are no trails or roads to this creek.  You have to walk through thick timber to get to it.  Since we were the only hunters in the direct vicinity, we ruled out it was a person doing it.  We could barely see anything down at the creek from where we stopped walking cause the timber was so thick.  We walked a little closer to see if we could see anything and the rock smashing started up again.  We thought it was time to leave and as we walked back to camp it stopped. The next morning we set out the opposite direction from the rock smashing of the day before. We went up the mountain this time, through a creek draw.  I was on one side of the draw walking the edge as my friend was walking on the other side.  The draw was wide enough to not hear each other when talking so we used radios.  About 1/2 mile from the experience we had the afternoon before my friend radios to me as says he hears something and had a unnerving feeling something was following him just above him on the treeline of the draw.  He could not see anything nor could I. He walked down into the draw and up to my side.  We walked up the draw together about another 20 yards when we began to hear what sounded like 2 large sticks being slammed together about 3-5 times in repetition.  The higher we walked the more we heard it. We could hear it parallel to us across the draw. After a few minutes we heard it parallel to us and then right away another set of stick slamming sounds came from about 100-150 yards just ahead of us on our side of the draw. We know we were being followed by something and there was more than one.  Afer that we turned around and left.

We arrived late morning July 31 at the Summit Lake Scout camp at the summit of Disautel pass located on the Colville confederated tribes reservation this is just a short ways off state route 155 in between Nespelem and Omak. I would like to give you as much information leading up to the incident of the evening of August 1st as I believe they are all related. After arriving and getting the lodge setup. We decided to take a hike. Though we had some planned hikes loaded in our handheld GPS we decided to just pick an open ridge about two miles distant and hike up to it sticking to no trails or roads just bushwacking. We had to skirt a logging operation which was clearing some thick timber on some very steep slopes using helicopters, to ferry the logs down the slope to more accesable sites to transport it. There was lots of fresh bear sign as there were wild Blueberries and huckleberries on the lower slopes. The next morning we planned a hike to a lake about 6 miles from our camp the lake is called grant lake I believe? We hiked south down SR 155 to the coyote creek camp ground then to the right down the asphalt rd about a mile into an area where we were supposed to have a permit to enter. We had the coordinates for the lake loaded into the GPS so we just went cross country until we arrived at the lake it was about 2 miles from the coyote creek camp ground. It is a small crescent shaped lake there was an old hunting camp with a tipi frame and an old travel trailer at one end. We spent the day napping and talking and the boys swam in the lake and ran around as boys are want to do. It was a nice day we had decided to camp overnight, we had no fires as the area was quite dry. The only wildlife I noticed was a family of Lesser Scaup ducks and a family of Canada geese on the lake. No fresh deer sign there had been some cattle in the area fairly recently, but we saw no cattle. Around dusk I decided to take a walk up on a rocky ridge a couple hundred yards north of the lake to see if I could get cell coverage to call my wife. As I left the boys were taking an old smoking rack apart and breaking the 3-5inch diameter lodgepole pine logs that it was made of against a tree most of these were rotten so they broke fairly easy but they were making quite a racket. When I reached the top of the ridge I could hear the sharp cracks as they struck the small logs against the tree. I walked back around the opposite side of the lake back towards our camp keeping an eye out for bear as I know they would start to move around dark as it cooled down, though with the boys so noisy and it being drier at this lower elevation ( not many berries at all) I doubted there were any around. But I felt a little uneasy for some reason?? So I headed back to our camp. As I approached the camp just before dark I smelled a musty smell like a pack rats den but stronger one of the other leaders commented yeah there is definately a skunk around. But it wasnt a skunk smell not that pungent just musty. So anyway I'm getting to the incident. We got the boys mostly settled and lights out in their sleeping bags about 10-11:00 O'clock I would guess. Shortly after they quieted down there was loud two part call with tremendous volume it was not man made it stated out lower then went to a high crescendo then followed by a shorter lower call. It did not sound like any of your recordings the closest sound I have found on the internet is the call of a male ibbon I believe some kind of Ape. It whatever it was repeated this call three or 4 times and got futher away each time the sound came from a draw at the north end of the lake where the soil was moist and there was fairly thick brush. I spend alot of time outdoors hiking hunting, and fishing. I have never heard anything like this sound. We had to help one of the boys who had found a leech on him. This was a few minutes after the call.I asked the boys did you hear that noise. They all said yeah what the heck was that. I said I have no idea never heard it before. A couple of the boys joked maybe it's bigfoot. I never really put everything together until later when I got home and the boys comment got me to thinking about the bigfoot possibilty. So I searched the Internet for bigfoot sounds and found your sight. After reading most all of the accounts there are some things that many of the other sightings include. I believe with the logging going on maybe this animal whatever it was was displaced from the thick timber up higher maybe it was attracted by the boys cracking the logs aginst the tree, and the musty smell shortly before the call. This call was very load and powerful and clear.\", \"location_details\": \"At Grant lake a small Lake on the Colville Indian Reservation\", \"county\": \"Okanogan County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 17570: Possible vocalizations directed at camp of boy scouts near Omak\", \"latitude\": 48.32956, \"longitude\": -119.187, \"date\": \"2006-08-01\", \"number\": 17570.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c2e4zy4sjd\", \"temperature_high\": 74.01, \"temperature_mid\": 60.92, \"temperature_low\": 47.83, \"dew_point\": 36.0, \"humidity\": 0.42, \"cloud_cover\": 0.02, \"moon_phase\": 0.23, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1013.3, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 9.0, \"visibility\": 7.66, \"wind_bearing\": 249.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.69, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.18700000000001 48.32956)\"}, {\"observed\": \"This hunting season we went to the same place we go every year up Falls Creek Road out side of Winthrop.

The natural trail that was formed by cattle and deer follows all along the bottom and we use it to walk the bottoms near the creek.  3 of us walked down and as we walked the trail every 10-30 yards were fresh trees broken over at about 5 to 8 feet.  These trees were anywhere from 6 - 15 inches in diameter.  Something would have to have a lot of strength to pull down and snap and have to be quite tall to grab as well.  They were all fresh.  These were not wind falls or caused by snow.  I can tell the difference.  Normally there are a number a trees that are snapped by snow or fallen over by wind.  These were random along a trail and where there was a break another tree next to it was fine and probably more susceptible to wind or snow.  When we got to the creek at about where we thought we heard the rock smashing from the year before you could see the trail continue on at the other side of the creek as if this was where all the animals crossed the creek at.  2 trees at about 5 feet apart on either side of the trail were both twisted over at their tops.  We also had what looks like foot prints coming out of the creek.  They were coming out of the creek on a small incline up to the top of the bank.  They were about 13-14 inches long and the stride was 4 to 5 feet apart.  I am 6' and it was hard for me to maintain that stride.  There were 4 prints in total.  Some better than others depending on the terrain.  It was right next to the creek so it was very hard and rocky.  However, all of the prints were deeper than my boot could make.  Something definitely heavy made the prints.  What was obvious was on all of the tracks the toes were very visible and were very wide at the front and the big toe was to the inside.  Being on an incline more of the weight was on the front and less on the back however a heal could be easily scene.  It definitely was not a bear doubling up the tracks.  We see bear prints all of the time around this area and these were nothing like this. It was raining when we discovered the tracks so it was hard to tell how old they might be.  My Dad, my friend, and I are convinced there is something unusual hanging around where we camp given last year and this year.\", \"location_details\": \"[Location specifics removed]\", \"county\": \"Okanogan County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 16631: Hunters find possible footprints and possible tree breaks near Winthrop\", \"latitude\": 48.458090000000006, \"longitude\": -120.1611, \"date\": \"2006-08-19\", \"number\": 16631.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c2de9tt2g6\", \"temperature_high\": 91.55, \"temperature_mid\": 78.845, \"temperature_low\": 66.14, \"dew_point\": 33.35, \"humidity\": 0.22, \"cloud_cover\": 0.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.87, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1013.17, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 7.0, \"visibility\": 6.8, \"wind_bearing\": 193.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.86, \"location\": \"POINT(-120.1611 48.458090000000006)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Two weeks ago my and my girlfriend were out hunting when we seen something running down the road. it was large and hairy and moved like a mother [It moved fast].

This potential incident happened on a deer hunt.  After seeing a herd of does, I found a buck trail leading uphill.  I followed the buck trail trying to find sign like, feces or tree marks.  I would come across some fresh buck feces every hundred yards up the saddle between Chopaka and Hurley mountain.  I saw buck sign everywhere, I marked it with a buck tarsal scent gland from a fresh deer kill from my friend.  I continued following the buck trail and signs up some very steep country with lots of boulders and dangerous rock fields.  I finally found and spooked whatever I was following; I never saw it but it stormed off over a rock field before I could get sight of it to shoot.  I am assuming it was a buck or sheep or mountain goat.  The fresh deer sign ended here and I decided to continue up, following old deer sign and camp.  It got very, very steep; I climbed approximately 2000 foot of gain to about 3/4 of the way up the saddle.  I was too tired to reach the top of the saddle, so I camped on the back side of a large tree in the midst of boulder fields.  There were many berry patches with thickets hard to pass through.  I built a soft bed for my sleeping bag and built a fire.  I saw a large pile of droppings that were black with lots of berries in it, probably bear; they were not round balls like the deer droppings I had encountered before.  I used a deer call throughout the day.  Sometime after the sun set, maybe 2 hours I heard a frightening scream come from the top of Mount Chopaka.  I had an excellent view of the snow covered peak from my slope side camp.  I have never heard a sound like this.  It was only one guttural scream.  I can describe it as a Pterodactyl (flying dinosaur) cry from a movie.  It had an extremely loud volume.  I slept with my .44 magnum ready for the worse.  Nonetheless, I didn't sleep well that night. A week or so before this incident, me and a buddy were hunting in Chinchelo Creek of the Sinlaheikin (wilderness area), which connects to the same woods as Chopaka.  We were using a dying rabbit call and we were sitting on logs waiting for a bear to come out.  We both heard a soft yet loud hissing sound pass behind us like a shadow.  We saw nothing, it was eerie almost as if a ghost had passed behind us. I also saw a shadow out of the corner of my eye as it passed.  This was very creepy.

One of our pit stops was at one of our favorite lakes, Lake Chopaka where the trout are huge, hungery, and numerous.  I was out on the lake with a tired arm and a grumble in my belly so I slowly headed toward camp. I arrived at camp and fixed myself a sandwich, the time is around noon.  As I sat and ate my sandwich I scanned the lake to figure out where I would fit amongst the other anglers when I returned to the water.  About halfway through my scan, my eyes stopped on what I thought was a guy trying to get cell phone service (yes the giant phones of 1996 did kinda work at the top of the small hill) on a little hill directly across from the boat launch.  Upon further examination I thought it was odd that the person was wearing a fur coat.  At this point I went into the camper to get some binoculars so I could get a better look at the \\\"bear\\\".  Upon even further examination, this time at 12x zoom I thought it was odd that the bear had really long arms, walked on two legs just as easy or more so than myself, and had a relatively short head with ape like features for a face.  I watched for probably five minutes or so as the creature lurked around the tree line at the top of the hill, and just like that it stepped over a fallen tree and disapeared into the shadows of the trees.  Confused and thinking myself delirious from the ravenous hunger developed from a long morning of hauling in heavy trout, I placed the sighting in the back of my mind. Out on the lake again, I was prepared just incase the \\\"ape bear cell phone guy\\\" showed it's self again.  Sure enough at about 1300 (1:00pm) or so movement caught my eye near a copse of trees by a rockslide on the bigger hill across the lake.  I gave it a good look at 12x and sure enough it was the same thing I saw about an hour before.  And after about 2 minutes it disapeared from view into the copse of trees it was lurking near.

The hill side has a lot of trees on it and is very steep and no roads on that side of the lake.

Left my car about 0700 and crossed over a dirt berm that had been pushed up blocking another service road. Thought it would be as good a place to do some research on a book that my son is encouraging me to write. Had hiked about 1000 feet when I spotted what appeared to be deer tracks heading over the road and down into the ravine, took a few photos and went down into the ravine. About 200 feet down I lost the tracks and noticed my battery on my camera was almost dead, searched my pack, like a dummy I had left it back in my camera bag in the car. As I started back up in the direction of the car I heard 2 loud wacks of wood on wood about 6 or 7 seconds apart and about 300 feet above and to the right of me. Thought maybe hunters but had seen no signs of campers, no sounds of vehicles or rifle reports. Reached my car and got the camera battery and was ready to hike back out when I noticed that at the opposite end of the berm about 10 feet from where I had crossed earlier that some thing had crossed it and had slipped. I got a little excited thinking maybe a deer and a possible good track. What I found set me back a bit and had me starring for a bit. I have been all over the Cascades, Olympics and have been from Compo to Monument 78 on the Pacific Crest trail four times. Have heard a lot of strange and different sounds and have later been able to say bird, Wolf,Cougar, Bear, Elk, etc. This I don't know. If it was human, as an Investigator and Fugitive recovery agent it would not be someone I would take down. If it is an animal, it is one I have never seen or seen tracks of personally. After several moments the Investigator in me kicked in and I photographed the prints I found and cast the one that appeared the best defined. Not sure how the cast will turn out being on a slope and not having any ring to assist in the casting.

G. and I am 48 years old. When I was a child I used to go to church camp at different camps through Public Welfare Assistance. We didn't have much money and my mother would send me to camp every summer. This summer was different for me for it was the first summer I was going to camp by myself. My sister would go with me in previous years. I am not sure where the camp is located other than it was near Mt. Rainier, Washington. The camp was named Camp Timberlake [now Camp Arnold]. This was a brand new camp and it was the opening summer for the camp. The camp had Boys Town and Girls Town. There was a lake that had a dock with a slide that spiraled. The dock floated out a few yards form the shore. All the cabins were \\\"A\\\" frames with a loft for the councilors. Between the boys' cabins and the girls' cabins was the dinning hall. I had a lot of fun that summer swimming, shooting guns and bow and arrows. The cabins were set within the fir trees and we had about eight boys per cabin. I think there were about fifty to seventy kids in camp. I was only about ten to twelve years old. (1965 - 1970) It was about the third day of camp when everything changed. We had retired for the night and everyone was in bed. I was awoken by loud noises. The counselor told us all to stay in our beds. I remember the boy who slept in the top bunk above me - I called him Silver Tooth for his front tooth was silver - looked out the window and said he saw several large hairy men around the water tower and the cabins and they were ten feet tall. I was scared so I hid under my covers and wished it would stop. The counselor was upset and said for us all to stay in our bed and to stay away from the door and windows. After what seemed to be hours the ruckus stopped and we went to sleep. The next morning when we went outside. Just in front of our cabin was a 30 to 40 foot fir tree tipped over and the root ball was up in the air with a hole in the ground about eight feet. There were human like foot prints everywhere. There must of been several of them and of different sizes. I saw hundreds of foot prints everywhere. They were from eight inches to maybe fourteen inches in length and depressed into the ground about a quarter of an inch. You could see the toes - think four or five -  I was pretty young and don't remember. They took us for a walk that day around the perimeter of the camp. I remember them telling us that the girls played a joke on us and that we were going to play a joke on them tonight. One counselors said you should see the dogs here they are five feet tall. As we walked, we came to the water tower where silver tooth saw the ten foot men, and there were large foot prints all around the water tower. When we got to the lake something had pulled a bunch of algae or sea weed out and it was everywhere. That night we played a scary record (didn't sound anything like the night before) and the counselor said we really got  back at those girls. When we woke up the next morning they told us we were going home early and we loaded the bus to come home two or three day early. Back in those days I never heard of Bigfoot. Later in my life the movie Bigfoot came out and I went to see the movie. When the Bigfoot came into the camp it brought me back to the night in camp and the noises I heard that night. As an adult I often think about that night and wonder how I could get a hold of someone else who was at Camp Timberlake that summer night. I know that all the adults must have seen them and even got some photos. My older sister said that she went to that camp on Mt. Rainer and at the gate it has a sign that says the only known sighting of Bigfoot. If you know of this sighting please, tell me how I can find more about it and maybe even visit the camp or get in touch with others that were there that night.

I was 14 yrs. old. My parents had bought a home on 224th. At that time, our home sat on 5 acres of heavily treed acres. There was a lot of dense brush, trees, and virgin wooded areas every where including 40 acres of virgin,untouched forest directly across from us on the other side of 224th street. When we first moved there in 1962; My whole family walked out to the forest across the street that I just mentioned and there was dense moss that covered the entire forest floor. In the moss were huge footprints twice the size of a man. There was a distinct musky smell throughout the whole area. I have been around all types of farm animals and had never experienced an odor like this. My father passed it off to my other brothers and sisters that someone was just trying to play a trick. The only thing was is that no one ever went out there. We soon discovered that at the back of our five acre home was a bog as my sister and I had begged to have horses. We soon began to experience weird screams from the back of the property every evening around sunset. On the date I gave in the beginning, I was watching F-Troop(a TV) show with my chair tilted back against a large picture window facing 224th street. My father was in the back yard working and sisters in the kitchen and I was alone. I glanced outside as I was watching TV, and saw this appromitely 7ft. tall grey man-like creature staring at me. It was not more than 5 ft. away from me as it was immediately on the other side of the picture window. Realizing that I just saw something; I turned back around and it was just standing there staring at me. It's eyes were dark and was slightly glowing red.(it was almost dark) It's arms were massive and came down to slightly below the knees. It was all grey in color with black and brown hairs here and there on it's body. I could see it's breathing. It's chest was rising and falling and steam was shooting out it's nose. It could have just reached out and broke that picture window easily from where it was standing and killed me too. I was frozen with fear and had to mentally get the strength to jump out of my chair all the time wondering if it was going to kill me.There was a light dusting of snow on the ground,so even though it was almost dark; the snow caused enough light so I could see every detail about this creature. I noticed that there was long hair smoothly covering it's whole face down slightly past it's jaws. There was no visual evidence of a neck at all. It looked like a massive head sitting on massive shoulders. It's chest and trunk looked large enought to fit two good size men side by side. It's nose and mouth were also covered in this long hair so I could only see where they came out of it's face. It just stood there still staring at me right in the eyes like it was looking right through me. I was so scared that I couldn't talk or scream for help to my mother and sisters in the next room. I was finally able to jump out of my chair and run to the kitchen to tell them what had just taken place. When I turned around;It was gone and I was too afraid to go outside to look for prints. The next day,my mother went out to look for a print,but all that was left was a muddy smear from melting snow. That summer(1971),maybe June I'm thinking, I was sitting on the floor of a bedroom facing the back of the property and not toward the street. It was a saturday and my sister was also sitting indian style on the floor,but she had her back to the two large windows that were on each corner of the house facing into that same bedroom. It was approximately 11:00A.M. and sunny.We were playing with paper dolls and I just looked up for a minute to see a grey man-like creature run past the first window,around the corner of the house past the second window on the other side of the bedroom toward the front of the house facing 224th. This one was considerably smaller;maybe 5ft. in height. I thought it was a youngster. Once again, I could hardly beleive I had just seen another one these creatures that was also grey. It was terribly frightning to see something like this never knowing that something like this existed. At that tine, there had been no sightings so I had not even a clue as to what I had even really seen! I began going to my school libray in secret because my family did not beleive me. When I finally found a book on the Yeti(the only book they had on the subject), and opened to a sketch of it;It was then I realized that I had seen something very like the sketch. During the next 25 years, our family and neighbors have experienced unexplained screams, permeating foul odors around that house at night;our horses being so frightened by something at night that they would run through barbed wire fences;to being followed by something as I was walking through the same dense woods at about midnight(I had snuck out of the house to meet a neightbor)and on the way back to stay in the next door neighbor's camping trailer in their back yard(it was fenced), something big followed me throught some densly treed area through my back yard and over a 3ft. fence to the camping trailer. Within just a split second after I jumped in and locked the camper door;something started pushing the trailer back and forth so badly that I thought it was going to be pushed over. That went on for about 30 seconds and then everything went quiet. I could hear the neighbor's dog barking but their parents never came to investigate. The neighbor girl and my sister were also in the trailer so we were all screaming! It was a very frightening night for us all. We have heard screams in the summer that brought us and the neighbors out in the night thinking that a woman was being raped in the woods across the street at night. Our family exerienced something that came up to the house at night in 1975 and picked up 1 1/2 cords of split wood and threw it as far as 100 yards away! We called the police and they went out there in back of our house to investigate. Those guys were back at our door in about five minutes.They said they had found some weird tracks that didn't look like it belonged to a bear. They were scared and told us to lock the doors and don't go outside for any reason and to call them if we needed them.The neighbors setting back on a hill next to that same house experienced something walking around her house at night also.I think they are still there.I now live in Auburn past the Casino on tribal land. About 3 months ago,our neighbor was walking home from school and saw a 20 ft. tree being shaken and she said something was screaming. The tree is about 200 ft. from the fence that seperates the forest and our mobile park.There is a river and dense forest and some old growth forest directly on the side and behind this mobile park.My son is 10 yrs. old and has been hearing weird screams early in the morning when he plays basketball. The sounds are coming from the direction of the forest. This morning,March 29,2004;I was up early and opened a bathroom window and happen to hear four distinct high pitched calls or screams that I have not heard before ,but were described and audibly demonstrated on the TV show Mysterious Encounters ;A cable channel show that I watch now every wednesday evening. It was the exact same sound. I know these creatures are real! I will never forget what I saw as long as I live and I think there are more of them around than we realize. Im looking forward  to evidence that will prove these creaaatures really do exist.Thank you for reading my experiences!

In the process of searching the area, he found a 14-inch human looking track (left foot) close to the front porch. No further investigation was carried on by the officer, but he did state to me \\\"Thinking about it now (Oct 14, 1975), that track could have been made by a Bigfoot, but I thought their tracks were bigger than that.\\\" He also told me that this was the second call to this residence in the past few months. Mrs. Tallik casted the track found by the officer and showed it to me on Oct 16, 1975. I photographed it. I sat down and listened to her story: 1) This all began in the summer of 1975. It was the start of massive destruction of wooded areas so as to build new homes in the area. The general area was a large swamp (called wetlands now) and during this construction residents noticed that there weren\\u2019t as many frogs around as in previous summers. There were 30 to 40 people who moved into the area in the last six months. The kids in the neighbor hood have found numerous (60) natural caves and old coal mines in the area... there is one 3/4 of mile from the Tallik's home. 2) 4 to 6 weeks ago Cindie Ostenson (daughter) age 21,: \\\"I was driving home from work about 11:15 when I saw 2 reddish looking eyes in the middle of the road, about 7 or 8 feet off the ground. As I approached the spot where I saw what looked like eyes... seemed to vanish in thin air or into the woods near by. But by the time I got close to what ever I saw, all I did see was like a shadow going in front of my headlights.\\\" She stated that it took off into the woods opposite their house. Mrs. Tallik told me that \\\"She came down the road honking her horn, pulled into the driveway and jumped out of her car and ran to the front door yelling 'Mom!' in a very frightened voice. 'There was something standing along side of the road with red flaming eyes.' I told her it was probably a deer or some sort of animal. She replied, 'No, it was taller than a person.' Later, the same night, Mrs. Tallik was awakened by what she thought was an earthquake, \\\"But after it ended so quickly I figured it must have been a bear.\\\" Footprints were found at the north end of the property the next day. Cindie had been scared so badly that she moved out a few days later. 3) A couple of days later, Mrs. Tallik's young sons were sleeping out in their back yard in a tent, when they heard their dog Heidi, start to whine. She suddenly flew against the side of the tent and the kids saw a shadow of something huge cross the tent and house. 4) A few days passed and one late afternoon, \\\"our dogs began barking. They were barking frantically down across the street towards the woods in front of our house. My youngest daughter, Shanne called her father to go and see why the dogs were having such a fit. The dogs remained on the side of the road and would not go into the woods. My husband approached the dogs and he told the dogs to get'em, but they refused to move. I was on the front porch at the time and I saw something of reddish blonde color, a man or something, hovering over and running through the woods.\\\" During this time and afterwards their dogs would act strange, \\\"Barking frantically and backing up against the front door. This became an almost every night occurrence.\\\" 5) 5-6 days ago, Hedi was found beaten to death in their driveway. I was bloodied across the nose and chest. 6) Tobie Summers told us of a few nights ago that down the street there were rabbits in cages and that several of them were found dead in the cages with sticks stuck through them. 7) 10/12/75 Backdoor neighbors to the Tallik's, Jennie Dempi heard a dog barking up against the side of the house she was babysitting in, then heard something heavy run across the roof. Mrs. Sandy Dempi and her sister Brenda King saw something move in their backyard. 8) 10/13/75 Strong and pungent odor seemed to be lingering in the air, heavy footsteps heard in the front yard and on the wooden porch of the Tallik's. Two ducks were found dead in the yard. 9) 10/15/75 Debbie Schmidt (another Tallick daughter): \\\"I was spending the night when at about 3:00 am I heard what sounded like 3 or 4 heavy footsteps with very large strides cross the yard. As heavy as the footsteps were it seemed as if what ever it was it had about the same weight as a small horse, 600lbs. Animal screams were heard also.

As we drove, I began noticing these big wooden cutout siloutes of what looked like to me was a Bigfoot. They looked like those silly black bear cutouts people put on their front lawns. Anyway these were like 7 or 8 feet tall. I asked my brother-in-law about them and he said \\\"Oh the farmers put those out to ward off Sasquach\\\" Being from Michigan, I had heard about Bigfoot, but these farmers took it seriously.

As we were walking down the path, my brother-in-law and I ended up towards the back, my nephews (5 and 7) and my mom and sister were in front. My brother motioned me to stop walking. And I did, and he stood there listening. I was like \\\"What?\\\" and he mumbled, keep walking and listen in the woods. My mom, sis, and nephews were oblivious anything was going on. So we started walking again, this time I was listening carefully in the woods and I heard off to my right, something heavy crunching an occasional stick, and what sounded like something stepping down into heavy forest bed, but it was slowly paced. My brother-in-law motioned for me to stop walking again. And when we stopped, it stopped. This time my sister and mom noticed we were stopping, and my mom said \\\"What are you guys doing, come on lets get going\\\" and we said \\\"We think we're being stalked\\\" and my mom said \\\"oh yea? by what one of those Sasquash things we saw down by the farms?\\\" And we said \\\"Yeah listen, start walking\\\" so we started walking and after a couple steps, we heard the heavy steps in the woods again.

We had often spoken and joked about various legends we had heard about Sasquatch inhabiting or existing in the Pacific Northwest, and being from Ohio, I was a thorough non-believer. We were travelling northwest along Flora Rd on north Fort Lewis between the Fort Lewis Museum and 41st Division Drive, approximately \\u00be mile from San Francisco Ave, at twilight, when we observed a large fur covered animal cross the road from left (w) to right (e) in approximately four (4 ) steps. It was walking upright, had a long lumbering gait, long arms, a large head, and walked mildly stooped at the shoulders, and appeared to be at least 8 feet tall. We stopped the truck and flipped on the bright headlights. Initially thinking it was a bear, I slowly rolled closer, excited about seeing my first wild bear on post. We were approximately 50 to 80 yards away, at the time. The animal stopped on the right side of the roadway at the edge of the trees, turned and looked towards us, and with one step, disappeared into the trees. I remember trembling and thinking I couldn\\u2019t believe my eyes. It was definitely NOT a bear! My partner and I stopped in the roadway, and got out of the truck. We saw where the pine limbs were still shaking where they had been parted by the animal, as it moved through. We could hear it walking ahead of us by about 30 or so yards, and then the walking noise stopped. We walked into the trees, towards where we last heard the sound. We both had our flashlights, but it was not yet quite dark, and were still in our camouflage uniforms. My friend was about 5 yards ahead of me, and we had gone about 30 yards into the woods, when a large limb cracked in a tree just ahead of us and there was a scream unlike anything I had ever heard. My friend turned towards me and began sprinting back towards the road, past me, yelling \\u201crun\\u201d, with his eyes wide open. I turned, running, to follow him and whatever the animal was, was now behind us, wailing what resembled a scream. We got back to the truck and we both noted that the other was \\u201cwhite as a ghost\\u201d. We rode back to the barracks in near silence. We both agreed that we had just witnessed and heard a bigfoot! The next day, after calming down considerably, we went back to the spot and found several high tree limbs bent and broken by something very large and very tall. The ground had a covering of both fresh green and brown pine needles, but no evidence of footprints. It has always been a running joke between us, even after all these years, that we encountered a sasquatch that evening. I have been a believer since that day. Many of our friends laughed at us when we told them, but several later admitted that they had seen something similar crossing the roads during late evening patrols around Ft Lewis, especially in the more remote training areas and roads, and near Solo Point at Puget Sound or near Sequalitchew Lake on North Fort Lewis.

It was around 9:00 am or so that my friend called me to see if I was doing anything. I was not, he told me he wanted to go up to the mountains for the day and do something and asked if I would like to go. I did so I got my stuff ready while he was on his way over to pick me up; all I grabbed was my boots and a .22 pistol, which was also what he was bringing (a .22 pistol). Anyway, on our way from my house, since we really didn't have any set plans on where we were going, I suggested that we go up to this rancher's place that we often hunted so we could look for antler drop offs while we walked along plinking with our pistols. We pulled up to the rancher's house but no one was home to tell we were going up on the hill, so we drove past his 400 acres to the next place, a 200 acre unoccupied place that we also had ongoing permission to hunt etc. So we began there at the east end of that place and worked our way through the woods all the way back to the first place. We decided to go ahead up the hill through this place where a trail starts and runs about 1/3 of the way up the side of the hill, the entire length of the ridge, and eventually comes out about 3 1/2 miles later on a logging road above Elbe. Our plan was to hit the logging road and walk down the road to the r/r tracks and follow them back to the truck. We, however, realized as we plinked that about 1/2 way along this trail that we would not have enough time left before dark to make it all the way to the logging road before dark let alone all the way back to the truck from there. But we knew if we cut straight down the mountain right where we were that we would make it to the valley below before dark. So we got started down through the heavy second growth and after about 45 min of fighting our way a long ways through thick tangling ferns and underbrush, we finally came out to a small group of clear cuts on the hill above another ranch. This was bad because these people never let anyone trespass on their land. But since we didn't have any other choice to get off the mountain before dark and since it was almost dark now we decided to go down the logging road very quietly as not to get caught on their land (this small road system is their own private operation and none of these roads go far or are connected to any other roads) to the valley below. As we quietly proceeded down this road we were half way through the last small clear-cut, it was just about dark, you could still see in the clear-cut and a long ways down the road, but not at all past the timber's edge. We were walking side by side; I was on the left, when I saw something out of place ahead and on the left. I immediately thought that it looked like a bigfoot standing there. We were about 100 yards away on the road from being straight across from it. I hadn't said anything yet, we just kept walking, angling closer as the road came closer to its location until we were straight across from it, about 80 yards away. The whole time I had not taken my eyes off it as we walked and I hadn't said anything yet because I thought it was going to turn out to be a stump or something (like when you see a burnt stump and it looks like a bear or something). That's when I stopped; I realized it was not a stump, I could see its arms, legs, and even some detail of it face. My friend stopped when I did. I was going to point this out to him, however when I stopped and looked at him he was already looking at it himself and said, and I quote, \\\"it can't be!\\\" We both just stood there for a minute, then my friend bends over, picks up a rock and throws it at it. He did think it must have been a stump until then. As soon as the rock landed this (and its still hard to say) bigfoot did not jump or run or seem scared at all, it just turned towards the dark timber behind it and walked into the forest. Please note that I am an avid hunter. I have hunted and harvested many animals including bears on this very hill. I've hunted from Alaska to Montana. I've taken many bears, even some at close range with my bow. I am very aware what all the animals look like and I am 100% sure this was a bigfoot. Before this, even with all the hunting and hiking that I have done, I never came across any tracks or other sign that I could not identify as normal forest animals, so up until this I thought that is was just a myth. Also, this is important as to the exact date, which I'm sorry I can't remember, but about a week later on our local news someone found tracks down by the river in this area. If that information could be found you would have a close date.

Lewis during a night patrol we got off of the path we were supposed to be on and ended up in some deep brush that was thick and hard to get through. I was the point man on the patrol and carrying a SAW which is a fully automatic machine gun and it was loaded with blanks. While busting through the brush I encountered something that was very big and shaped like you would think bigfoot would be shaped but only saw it in the dark with no lights except for the moon. This large thing and myself were within probably ten feet of each other and it scared us so badly that I opened fire on it with the SAW and the blank rounds to run it off. It ran through the brush on two legs taking huge steps each time and busted through the brush like it was nothing and disappeared over the hill in seconds.

This was in 1997 before computers and google so I had heard rumors afterwards that Washington was a hot spot for bigfoots. I never knew until now when I ran into this website that there is more sightings of bigfoot in that area than anywhere else in the US. I googled to see what county Ft. Lewis was in and was very surprised when reading through the stories from that county that there was several other sightings on the base such as mine.

My husband Dana and I had been on one of the first episodes of \\\"Mysterious Encounters\\\". My son and ten year old grandson had come over to watch the tape with us. Brenden had heard us talking about Bigfoot before but having never seen a picture of one, he did not know what they looked like. I put the tape in and as it showed the first picture of a Bigfoot Brenden turned to me and said, \\\"Grandma, I've seen one of those\\\". Stunned, I paused the tape and asked him about it. He was living in Orting, WA. at the time beside a small creek, which ran parallel to the Puyallup River. It ran along the base of the hill that the old Soldiers cemetery is on. It is a wooden area with a lot of deciduous trees. Some fir, and brush. He said it happened when he was about six years old. He had crossed the creek and was starting to climb up the hill. He heard a noise and looked up to see it standing in the woods. He said at first it stunned him but he also felt scared so he ran down the hill, jumped across the creek then looked back at it. It was looking at him but turned, walked up the hill and disappeared into the woods. I interviewed Brenden on May 8, 2004. Here is his answers to my questions. Did you tell anyone?   B. No, it was too freaky. Where did you see it?  B. On hillside behind my house. He walked through a clearing from left to right, then looked at me, turned and went up hill and disappeared. Did it scare you?  B. It stunned me but I wasn't really scared. What did you think it was?  B. I just thought it was someone in a suit. What time of year?   B. It was still hot during the day but colder at night. Where were you?  B. Twenty feet up the hill till I saw it. Then I ran back down the hill and jumped across the creek and then looked back at it. It looked at me and then disappeared into the woods. What made you look up?  B. It made a noise. What kind of a noise?  B. Ahhheerrrraaahhhooo. What time of day?  B. Evening, starting to get dark but still light. How long were its arms? B. arms came to about its knees. Way longer than people's. Was it big and muscular or tall and skinny?  B. It was big and muscular. How big was it.  B. Oh about as big as this house. (We have eight foot tall ceilings) When you jumped across the creek, how is it you could see it through the trees?  B.  There was a clearing you could see from across the creek. The woods were not grown up as much. I went back to the spot about the second week of May. It is now very brushy but I think he may have had his encounter closer to fall when many of the leaves would have been off the trees. He could not remember what time of year. The hillside is very brushy and in spring at least very swampy. Fish are in the stream and it is a very shallow creek. This hillside runs from Orting all the way to Puyallup, and is brushy the entire way. There is a recording of bigfoot sounds from Shaw Road in 1972. I lived just off Shaw Road from 1985 until 1997. Although I did not hear any strange noises my neighbor immediately to the left of my house did. Her house sat with her back yard to the McMillin Reservoir and it is bordered by the woods that run the length of the valley.

I was on my way to farm-sit for my friends, who have a large piece of property in woods and pasture. It was full dark, with scattered lights from houses and pole lights in some yards. A 4-foot cyclone fence ran alongside the lane, with open gates at intervals. I passed a man walking in the same direction on my left, and shortly after passing him, I noticed someone else moving on the other side of the fence, through the yards. I turned my head to get a better look, and saw the figure from the side and behind as it passed me going the opposite direction on my left. The 'person' was extremely tall and broad. I thought for a minute that it might be a bear, but it was moving completely upright, with the gait of a man. I probably saw it cover about 100 feet very quickly, and it was soon out of my field of vision. The figure was completely uniform in color, with no lines of demarcation that would indicate clothing or skin. Then, with a sense of wonder, I realized that it must have been a Sasquatch. Possibly the line crew working down the street, which had lots of flashing lights going, drove it off its normal path. I don't know why I didn't stop the car to get a better look, except that I was tired and already late getting there. As I got out to unlock the gate, I had a few seconds of trepidation, but was soon greeted by the three large dogs I had come to tend, so I felt secure. That night, I left all the outdoor lights blazing.  About midnight, I was startled awake, but I don't recall what the sound was. The dogs went crazy, and made so much commotion that I had to let them out. Once outside, they just ran around in circles sniffing. They calmed down right away when I let them back in. In the morning, I looked to see if there was something in one of the yards that I could have mistaken for the figure I saw, but I could find nothing. I checked again the following night, in case it was a shadow or something, but again, there was nothing there. I don't think that there would be footprints, as the ground is extremely rocky there, and it has rained heavily since then. The following weekend, leaving early on Sunday morning, I heard a strange scream coming from the woods. I chose to think it was some kind of bird, but it was definitely unusual, and definitely not the peacock which lives in the pasture. On the 21st , I was locking the gate as I left, and the neighbor came out to talk. I told him my story, and he told me that a week or so earlier, he and his wife had been awakened by a loud scream right outside their bedroom. He felt whatever it was must have been inside his fence, a five-foot solid wood enclosure. They were both frightened by it, and had never heard that sound before or since.

This incidence took place over a two day period in the forested area of Wa. near green water area off of FS road 70 at a lake in the Greenwater Wa. area off of hwy 410. My husband and I camped at this lake every Thanksgiving weekend from 2002-2005 and on our last holiday 4 day weekend that we were there we experienced something of an encounter with what I believe to be a bigfoot. It was a Saturday morning when this started and it started with huge ear shattering deep growling howl like screams....more like warnings from something that did not want us there. We were the only human occupants in that area since it is very cold and most people are enjoying their weekend watching football and stuff at home. this lake is very isolated and a trek to get into since the road is overgrown with bushes and hard on vehicle paint jobs. We were cooking breakfast when this screaming at us started and it was such an unusual sound that it made my hair stand up and made me afraid to go into the woods to use the bathroom. There were many of these gutteral warning screams and they were watching us and I know this for fact since I was being brave and going to go down towards the lake and it scream growled at me and the force was so intense that the vibration from the sound literally knocked me back a step!I did not go down to the lake since I knew this noise was a warning! It was warning us to stay away from certain parts of the area that we were camping at. that night as we lay sleeping in our tent trailer there was a wind storm and I was waken by the sounds of our cooking gear being clanged like it was being kicked and thrown about. I was scared out of my wits when I heard what sounded like a load of logs being dumped beside the tent trailer. I woke my husband and was yelling at him to get up and lets just leave and come back in the morning and pack up and go. He said no and we stayed the night and when I got up the next morning and went outside all of our cooking stuff was all back where it had been except for some items that had been misplaced but not by the wind.  I can not explain why I heard the metal pans clanging in the night like they were bing banged together and I was thinking from the wind storm our stuff would be everywhere but it wasn't. The screaming growls started again that Sunday morning as we were moving about camp and fixin breakfast. My husband asked if I could smell a stench and I said no since I have allergies and he proceeded to go into the woods behind our camp to do his business when this thing let out a long screamgrowl and it was enough to turn my husband around and back o camp. My husband has grown up in this area and has hunted the area for many years and he said he has never heard anything like this before. My husband does not spook easily however this made him think twice. We camped there many times and have had several experiences with this wood clapping ad whistling your research suggests. Every time we go there we feel we are being watched and hear the wood claps and I have even heard heavy breathing from something eating some hot links that I thrown down the hill from camp. This is a very squatchy area and should not be overlooked since I can recall the wood claps and some whistles and even some calling in the distance not done by us and it was at dusk when we heard the calling across the way.This thing watched us for two days and scream-growled at us both that Saturday and Sunday.

Rainier to do some trap shooting. We turned onto a very bumpy, pot-holed gravel road a few miles from the town of Ashford. After getting through a number of trees that had blown down in the wind storms of winter, 2006, we reached a dead-end at a bridge over the Nisqually River that had washed out in the record rains and flooding of November, 2006. We were about a mile...maybe more..from the nearest blacktop road and any human habitation. We had decided to make a day of shooting so we brought an automatic trap machine, several boxes of biodegradable clay pidgions, LOTS of shotgun shells in trap loads, chairs, a folding table, plenty of food and drinks (coffee, water, fruit juices, tea) however...no alcohol because my friend and his wife are diabetic and I take meds that don't mix well with alcohol. Therefore, we just don't drink. Besides, booze and guns NEVER go well together under ANY circumstances. After several hours of shooting clays, we decided to have a bite to eat and sat down at the table we had set up right behind my open truck canopy. We were eating and talking and listening to some great oldies on an MP3 radio when I noticed my friend R-- looking intently into the forest behind me. I asked him what he was looking at and he said he wasn't sure. He said that he saw what looked like a very large stump about 25-30 yards back in the woods when it appeared to move slightly. When it did so, R-- said that for a few moments he could see daylight under the stump----as if he were looking between someones' legs, which then disappeared after it moved. Of course we all looked and sure enough, through a long, narrow opening in the trees we could see what looked to be a very large, dark stump with a somewhat rounded pointy top. The \\\"stump\\\" looked to be about 7-8 feet tall and at least 3 feet wide. It was hard to gage height because the undergrowth was so thick and dense that it was hard to know how much of the \\\"stump\\\" was hidden from our view from the ground up. Something that we began to notice as we looked around was that we saw a few other stumps but none of them were as large or as tall as the \\\"stump\\\" we were looking at, nor were there any trees that were even close to the diameter of our stump anywhere. Also, the other stumps were obviously cut down with a chain saw leaving a fairly flat--maybe slightly angled or beveled top on them. Our stump angled up from both sides to a slightly rounded point in the middle. It did not move. We all watched the stump and talked and joked about what it could be. After a half hour or so, the stump was still there, not moving, so we decided to go back to shooting trap. I think by this time we had all come to regard the \\\"stump\\\" as just that, a stump in the woods. The movement my friend saw was attributed to the fact that the wind was blowing and the moving tree branches created moving patterns of shadow and light in the forest. After about another hour of shooting we decided to start cleaning up and getting ready to leave. I sat on my chair to put my shotgun in its' case and without really thinking, I glanced back into the forest to look at the stump. It was gone! I thought maybe I had moved the chair and was looking in the wrong place. So, I moved the chair around and found that there was only one narrow opening through the trees where the \\\"stump\\\" could have been and there was no getting around the fact that it was not there. I called R-- over and told him that the stump was gone. He too looked and looked and could not locate our stump. Our wives by now were there and they too agreed that the \\\"stump\\\" was gone and that they were more than ready to leave, A.S.A.P. We began to go over any possible explanation for what we had seen. Deer? Nope. Too small and even if a deer had been standing perfectly facing us, we should have seen the narrowing of the chest into the neck and the small head and large ears. Elk? Nope. Same arguement as with a deer. Bear? Well, if it was a bear, it would have had to have been standing on its' hind legs facing directly at us and not moving a muscle for at least a half an hour...probably more. Besides, we should have seen the outline of the bears' body narrowing to a neck and then going to the nearly round profile of a bears' head, and again, we saw no ears. Also, it would have had to have been an absolutely HUGE bear to equal the height and bulk of the \\\"stump\\\". Also, we could not imagine any of the afore-mentioned animals staying around as close as this for so long a time considering we had shot around 300 rounds of 12 and 20 gauge shotgun shells in the time we were there. As we began to drive back out to the highway we officially went on \\\"sasquatch watch\\\". It was the only thing that fit what we had seen. This area is totally wild and all any creature would have to do is cross the Nisqually River for nearly complete solitude because of the washed-out bridge. What really began to shake us up was the fact that whatever this was that we saw was not afraid of us or the noise and concussion of our shotguns. It appeared to be observing us at the time we first noticed it and it remained stock-still for 30-45 minutes while we observed it at a distance of 25-30 yards. How long it was in the area watching us before we noticed it or how long it stayed around after we lost sight of it is un-nerving to say the least. Was it watching us out of curiosity or was it being territorial and wanted to see who was on its' turf? It sure makes us wonder. While sasquatch has long been a topic of lite conversation on our various shooting and fishing trips, this incident certainly has us believing that maybe there IS something out there in our forests that we don't know about. We can't prove its' existance beyond our sighting and the multitude of others who have seen something they can't explain. I know from now on, every trip into the forest will hold a whole new sense of wonder and exitement and will have a renewed expectation and hope that we might see something again to further explain what we saw today!\", \"location_details\": \"The paved road was HWY 706 between Elbe and Ashford.

We had come from Tacoma and I was trying to get my husband acquainted with being in the woods at night, so we headed up to a place I liked to go occasionally to start a fire and cook some food and relax.  It was a site for what looked like an old rock quarry alongside the right hand side of the woods. I chose the spot because it was fairly open to the road and there were also a large number of campers dotted throughout the woods and along the river at the time.  It should also be noted that it was foggy. We pulled into the muddy rock pit(we were driving a '69 220 Mercedes) drove in about 50 feet and then noticed something in front of the car.  My husband seemed panicked and wondered what the hell it was.  It was gray(light colored)big, human shape, visible right in front of our car no more than 15 feet from the front bumper.  Even though I knew it wasn't human or a known animal, I told him it was a deer's butt and not to be scared. He has stopped the car at this point and then we both witnessed the creature climb up the side of the quarry at a high rate of speed.  He was terrified, but for some reason, I wasn't scared at all even though I had just something unexplainable.  I convinced him to park and we got the stuff out the trunk headed up the other side of the quarry and started the fire.  By the time it was really going it was dark out and we were just sitting and talking.  It also started to rain a little.  I had the unerving feeling that we were being watched.  That was when we saw headlights coming up the road and turning into the quarry.  It was the sheriff.  He stopped at our car then came up the side of the quarry in his truck, shining his search beam on us as he ascended.  After asking what we were doing he left and headed down the side of the quarry in which we had seen the creature earlier.  I noticed about a quarter of the way down he stopped and shone his light into the woods at which time the previously viewed creature was spotted standing at the edge of the woods.  It turned around and headed back into the woods and the sheriff sped down the side of the quarry.  I bet he remembers it, but I don't remember his name. We left immediatelly. It should also be noted that I didn't feel scared at all and I almost forgot that I had seen the creature until we drove home and my husband reminded me.

We werent sleeping very soundly we were both waking throughout the night.  At about 3am I woke up and noticed the fire was about to go out, I hoped out of the truck turned some logs on the fire, took a leak and crawled back in bed.  No sooner then I got comfortable a very loud whoopish sound that turned into a bird sound at the end, it was all one breath no pause, much to loud to be a bird, and it was within 25 yards of my camp.  Within 30 seconds another one answered back from what I would guess to be a mile away atleast.  I grabed the flashlight and the rifle(just in case)I shined the light in the tree line. As soon as I turned the light on it got spooked, it got out of there but it wasnt a full run more of a jog. It was so close could hear the thuds of its feet on the ground.  I was tired and fell back to sleep within a hour or so my girlfriend couldnt sleep and said she heard another vocalization more distant then the first two.

Then, about 20 minutes later, the neighbors dogs on the other side of the 5 acres of woods between us started losing their minds and barking their heads off, and almost immediatly, I heard 4 or 5 siren-like calls(think of the vocalization that you hear on the 1994 A&E Bigfoot documentary). Very loud, very clear. From the 3rd call on, they faded as whatever made them seemed to be heading back deeper into the woods. Then, about 10 to 15 minutes later, the dogs went off again and I heard this chatter-like vocals, almost threatening sounding. It seemed to have a variation of sounds within the chatter. Like a mix between human-like barks/grunts, and an indescribable chattering that I just cannot explain. It did this for a few minutes, off and on. Seemed like it was taunting the dogs.

It was a whooping, tongue clicking type of sound and it was really creepy. Reminded me of the ape cage at the zoo except for the weird sound at the end. We started making similar sounds back at it and it started answering us. Then, we heard it walking north in the treeline while continuing to make the sound.  We grabbed our guns and jumped back into the truck. It made it's way around to the other side of where we were but never stepped out into the open. After a few minutes, we heard and felt a thud on the road about 20 feet from our truck. We locked and loaded our guns and went to check it out. There was a small boulder in the middle of the road that was not there a few minutes before. I could tell it had been thrown there due to the fresh indents in the ground and marks on it. We scanned the area and the sounds started again, this time from the treeline on our right. The fog was lifting and we walked towards the area the sounds were coming from. All of a sudden, we heard something very big moving through the forest away from us. It was breaking tree branches and we could hear it walking through the underbrush.

I was awakened abruptly out of a deep sleep when a very loud animal scream made me sit straight up in bed, scaring the hell out of me.  For about 15-20 seconds I wondered if maybe I had imagined it, when suddenly another long, loud screaming came.  It was very loud- and close, and it was obvious by the volume and intensity that it was something big.  I guessed the screaming to be about 10-20 feet away from the house, outside my bedroom, on the lawn.  There is roughly 60 feet of lawn between the house and the woods and the screaming sounded like it was maybe one-quarter to one-third away from the house towards the woods. The hair stood up on my neck when another long, loud scream came, and I wondered what in the hell was doing it?  The volume and intensity was much louder and deeper than a person could possibly make and it wasn\\u2019t consistent with any animal we have heard here before- Deer, Elk, Bear, Coyote, Cougar, etc. I walked into our living room where I looked out the window hoping to see better, but it was too dark in the yard and I could not see beyond a few feet.  I slid the window open to try to hear anything and about a minute later another loud scream erupted through the night but it now sounded like it was just off our lawn and into the woods.  After this scream there was a series of loud sounds that I can only describe what sounded like distressed grunts, barks, and cries followed by shorter screams.  Almost like something was possibly injured or distressed.  Then to my surprise something screamed back- off into the woods from the right, which I guessed to be a few hundred feet away.  This went on, back and forth about 10 to 15 minutes when I realized our three dogs had not been barking during any of the commotion, which was very unusual.  They always bark at animals and people that come onto the property and usually chase after the animals.  I went to the glass slider door at the back of the house and found all three dogs cowering on the back porch as close to the door as they could get.  They were all scared and acted nothing like normal. I went back to the open window in the living room and listened for a few minutes and noticed the screams and noises were getting further away and deeper into the woods.  The back and forth screaming slowly got further away and then the furthest one quit altogether.  The closest one did a few more screams further into the woods and then it too stopped.  After a while I went back to bed but was awake for a couple hours as I tried figuring out what could have made that kind of noise.  Bigfoot had crossed my mind but I really didn\\u2019t believe something like that could be- that only happens to other people.  But nothing else made sense of what it could have been. It wasn\\u2019t until recently when my wife and I talked to a person who told us she knew two people who had seen a bigfoot on our property back in the mid \\u201880s that I began to really think it was possible that Bigfoot was what I had actually heard.  A friend came across this site and told me about it, and I read about other sightings and sounds in the area that made it more plausible.

Thank you. September 23, 2011, Myself and a group of friends decided to go camping late one night near the, White River. We took about a 40min walk to get to our campsite.(it was a little after 11pm.) 5min after we arrived, we heard an Elk Mating call from across the river and thought it was pretty cool, didn't think much of it. About 30min in, after we get the fire going, we heard another unexplainable \\\"yelp\\\" sound that echoed off. It was only one time, from a distance, possibly 1/2 of a mile or less out. We all looked at each other as if one of us could explain what it was but we couldn't and again, didn't think much of it. About a few hours later after roasting marshmellows and havin a good time, we decide it's time to hit the hay, one guy, the only one of us who drank too much, was already passed out. (There was 4 of us!) My best friend and I crawled into the tent and the 4th guy decided to stay outside for a little longer. After 2min or so he called out to us, \\\"I keep hearing something over by the river, like it's really close to us.\\\" He then grabbed the cheap flashlight from our tent and pointed it in the direction he heard the sound and then, \\\"Oh my god, I see something by the river, I can't make it out but it looks big.\\\" (we've camped at this location before and nothing unusual has ever happened.) Now, I aint dumb, I felt like he was just trying to scare us becuz he likes to do that when we're out camping and he has before but he's never made any pranks like this, he looked pretty white in the face, eyes where all wide like he was really scared. After he was done observing, he climbed into the tent with us and decided to call it a night but every so often he'd peek his head out to check and kept talkin about what he saw. It was scaring me a little. 2-3 hours probably passed and both 2 guys where out cold, me and my best friend were still awake, we were too shook up about what he saw. Then out of no-where, we heard this LOUD KNOCK on a tree, right next to our campsite, close to were our fire was. Scared the living hell out of us. We kept very quite and still, didn't speak a word! After a long while passed we didn't hear anything unusual and my friend was drifting off to sleep. I was too scared. I think I stayed up for another hour and that's when I got the living daylights scared outta me! Just outside our tent, I could hear something walking closer to us, like something with 2 feet. Sticks were cracking and I could hear lite footsteps on the ground. Like it was trying to be quite not to wake us. I heard it brush the tent a little. I was paralized with fear. My best friend was laying next to me. I woke her up, going insane with the noise. I didn't speak a word to her, just looked at her and feeling fear and she knew something was wrong. Within 10 seconds after waking her, the crunching of the sticks started again and the lite footsteps followed. We woke up the guy who complained of seeing something. He peeked his head outside the tent and saw nothing, (it was also very dark, you wouldn't of been able to make out things 4 feet from you.) About 10min later, we all layed quite and remained a alert. Then, the snapping of sticks came back but it started going away from us until eventually, we didn't hear it anymore. When dawn approched I finally felt safe to sleep, We woke around 11am and i started to investigate. I looked around the tent and on the ground. Didn't see anything unusual, no footprints, I didn't really have a lot of time to investigate becuz everyone wanted to leave. I also wanted to try and mimic the crunching sound I heard, (I'm not very good at analizing things either, broken sticks would seem natural to me.) I walked out toward the river bank were our guy friend said he saw something, didn't see any footprints, if something was there, it would of left behind a track in the mud. Our tent was set up over hard ground and low brush. If you think this could of been a possible BF encounter or something else. Let me know! I don't think I'll be camping out there again.\", \"location_details\": \"You can find our exact campsite if you go in-between The Loggers Rodeo and Glacier Middle School.

Private, full-time residence and immediate surrounding area.   Rural.  Heavily wooded rugged terrain, south-west of Mount Rainier National Park.   There is nothing behind (north) of this location for many miles. There are numerous logging roads thru this area both maintained and old.  Many drainages, streams and game trails  There are no homes or residents throughout the area north of us.  It is mountainous and wild. Wildlife:  Large deer and elk population, bear, cougar, owl, fox\\u2026 all seen on the property.  If it is native to this immediate area, it\\u2019s likely here. Incident Descriptions: April 27, 2012 -  Witnesses: PC and neighbor FP. Around noon on the 27th both witnesses heard exceptionally loud and continuous screams for approximately twenty minutes moving from east to west in the tree-line to the south of their homes as though something was \\u201cbeing chased\\u201d and \\u201cin fear of its life\\u201d.  Both witness\\u2019s are in their eighties.  PC grew up in the area and returned here to live 2.5 years ago.  FP has lived in the area for over twenty-seven years.  Both are familiar with the sounds of wildlife in the area and both state that they \\u201chave never heard anything like this before\\u201d.  The screaming was described as human like, but not human.  Moving rapidly as though being chased.  The sound \\u201cwent through them\\u201d and \\u201cscared the life out of\\u201d them.  When asked why they didn\\u2019t call 911 they both said that they should have, but did not know what or how to report what they were hearing and thought they would be \\u201claughed at\\u201d.   I (LC, PC's son) was out of town during this incident, but it was reported to me by my mother during a phone call that same day.  During that call I told her that both FP and her had likely heard some elk running through the woods. May 18/19, 2012 \\u2013 Witness LC (reporting source).  I had just returned home from playing hockey in Seattle and was unloading the car behind my house at 3am.  I felt I was being watched.  It was pitch black out and the Baard Owls were going crazy all around the house.  Then the owls stopped like a switch had been  thrown.  After a brief pause something yelled at me from about 100 to 150 yards away (?) in the woods\\u2026 somewhere between me and the stream behind us anyway.  I have never heard anything like this in my life.  It was human like, but not human.  The sound went right through me.  It felt like a less than lethal crowd control weapon (I spent 25 years in the military / civil service with multiple overseas tours and had been exposed to these).  The hair on my body stood straight up, I felt chilled and distinctly \\u201cwarned off\\u201d.  I left my hockey sticks in the car (anyone who knows me knows that I do not leave my sticks anywhere!) and went strait inside the house.  I told J (my fianc\\u00e9) that \\u201cI was done\\u2026 something just yelled at me out there\\u201d and called it a night.  The next afternoon my mother, PC, asked if I heard that thing outside last night.  I told her yes and she said that was exactly what she and FP had heard for twenty minutes a few weeks before.  It was not any animal that I have heard before and I\\u2019ve heard weird owl calls, strange cougar sounds, fox etc.  This was at a volume and resonance that was off the chart.  I could literally feel the sound pass thru me.  For the next few weeks while out back, I was feeling watched\\u2026  not all the time, but frequently. May 28/29, 2012 approx. 11pm to 2am \\u2013 While laying in bed I could hear a faint sound like what was heard earlier in the month.  It sounded as if it was on or near a ridgeline to the north of the house.  Around 2am J said she heard it too and it was \\u201creally weird\\u201d. Aug 12, 2012 \\u2013 I was mowing the lawn in the back (north) of the house when I hit a rock with the lawnmower.  I still have the bruises from where the rock hit my leg as I write this.  Aside from being injured, I was annoyed that there was a rock in that portion of the yard as I had been continuously clearing the area of rocks for quite a few weeks and had that specific area clean.  As I looked around the area I found that there wasn\\u2019t just one rock, but nearly a hundred rocks all about fist sized laying around the area, about five to fifteen feet from the wood-line.  There are no kids in the area and I do not know of any animals that distribute rocks on the ground as if thrown. Aug 19, 2012 \\u2013 While visiting with GJ and TJ, a part-time neighbor who has a cabin approx. \\u00bc mile to the east of us I asked \\u201chave you heard the screaming man?\\u201d  When I asked this GJ turned almost white.  He said that both he and his wife TJ had in-fact heard what I was describing \\u201ca few months ago like May, maybe\\u201d.  They said they had not reported it because they had \\u201cno idea of what it was\\u201d, but that it had scared them too. Note:  I have been hesitant to write this report, but was convinced to do so by this final report from GJ and TJ.  I started this report by indicating a possible 2011 event.  This occurred from Late April to mid-June of 2011, so the same approx. timeframe of these recent incidents, though separated by one year.  All I can say is that both J and I heard \\u201ctalking\\u201d between what sounded to be a male and female human back in the woods on multiple nights (after midnight usually).  This was strange as there is nothing back there.  But we both remember hearing only \\u201cmumbling\\u201d, no clear speech.  But that mumbling had to have carried for at least a hundred yards \\u2013plus for us to have heard it.  I wrote it off at the time as potentially game control officers looking for poachers.  But looking back now I also considered it very strange. If nothing else, I hope this report adds a few more data points to your efforts.  There have been multiple events in this area over the years, but people are very reluctant to discuss them.  You can feel free to contact me and I have the permission of all reporting sources to include their names in this report.

My son immediately asked me if I heard the whispering as well. The \\\"whispering\\\" sounded like someone was whispering loudly and it sounded like a foreign language or gibberish of some sort. I first thought that is was outside in my back yard but wanted to clear my house first to be sure someone wasn't in my home. shortly after looking around my house I the whispering stopped. five or six days later  on July 4th I was in my back yard getting ready to cut the grass when I noticed the area of my yard where the grass was higher was trampled down and there was a feces pile in the grass. I have seen scat from most all of the animals in my area and this didn't appear to come from any of them. It was very large, black and looked like it came from a human. my first thought was that someone took a crap in my yard. I then called my son to come take a look and he reminded me of the whispering that had taken place days earlier.

This street turns into a two lane country road that makes one of the borders of Joint base Lewis-McChord. It is a long dark two lane country road that bisects a huge prairie with lots of old growth woodlands bordering it. I drove home the back way again tonight hoping to pinpoint the exact location for you, but there are no mile markers nearby where I seen what I saw. The best I can do, is it is Approximately 4-5 miles out from town, the road is largely flat and straight, but there are a few rises as you drive. The place I was at was about 3-400 ft from the second place where there is a rise in the road. I know this because I could see the creature with a hill in the background and some trees, and when we drove up through there tonight there was no place else that fit those two things. First off, it was very dark, and oddly devoid of cars, as there is usually someone flashing their lights at me as my car has a headlight out and I have been driving with my brights on until payday to get it fixed. I think if I had not had my brights on, I would never have seen this creature. At any rate, suddenly I seen the Patterson Film in real life, about 400 ft down the road ahead of me. The creature I saw fit the same color scheme of Harry and the Hendersons, but in behavior it was nearly identical to the Patterson film. It strided across the road in 3-4 strides, and in as many was way off to the right again when it stopped mid-stride and looked back at me exactly like the patterson film, but this thing looked huge, even from the distance I saw it. When you see something that does not fit into the ordinary part of what you perceive as your reality, your brain tries to pidgeon-hole the data into one file after another, click click click click and suddenly you come up with \\\"Does not compute\\\" At first I thought was a smudge on my windshield, but it was moving right along. Just like the patterson film. So I went to work, and several people live near me and I decided to tell somebody. One guy had a girlfriend who seen him within a mile of my house within a month ago, and then a week ago his father came home at midnight telling him he had seen one in the same area in the headlight of his Harley where a small creek runs under the road and the creature appeared to be crossing the road where the small bridge was. It's weird how this effects you. I could really see how someone could keep this to themselves for their entire lives. However, when I shared this story, I got \\\"Oh yeah, this happened and that happened,\\\" To \\\"My Cousin, My Brother, My Dad, and even a couple of personal stories from people who grew up here. I was always willing to give it an open mind, but the lack of physical evidence sort of left me wondering, if I had to be honest. Now I know we share our woods with one big sumbitch, and you better be paying attention when you are cookin up that bacon at 8 pm in the woods around here cuz I don't think he got that big eatin dandelion greens. :) My impression, one HUGE Chewbacca/Harry and the Hendersons kinda guy, at least 2.5-3 ft thick thru the chest from back to front and if I had to estimate would be tall even for a Sasquatch at 9-12 ft like I said it was a quite a ways up the road, but I had time to see it, evaluate, and question it and look again, and then again after that as it looked to the right at me coming down the road, so it was a pretty firm sighting even if I am still questioning myself the next day. Like I said your brain tries to rationalize anything that \\\"Does not Compute\\\" but I was not under the influence of anything. Still puzzling and marvelling over it all.

We called another couple who had camped there with us and asked if they and their children wanted to go along. We were primarily interested in seeing how much water was going through the creek. We arrived at Bear Creek about noon. It was an overcast day, with a drop or two of rain. There was still snow on the road to our property, but it was slushy, and we didn't have any problems getting to the cable that was across the entrance to our camping sight. I was the first one to climb over the cable and start down the road. I had walked down to the bend in the road (snow was still deep in this road since it was well shaded). After I got around the \\\"corner\\\" I saw these \\\"huge\\\" depressions in the snow, and upon further examination decided they were footprints. The footprints came from the direction of our camping sight, and then at the bend in the road, angled off toward the creek and just kept going into the trees lining the bank of the creek. About that time, the rest of the party had caught up with me. I told them to \\\"stop!\\\" and look at what I had found. We all stood around trying to figure out how and why anybody would have been walking up the road and then over to the bank of the creek. It then dawned on all of us how big these footprints were....and the stride was enormous. My husband (6'1\\\" tall) tried to match the stride, and was short of making it by nearly 2 feet. We stood there for quite a while discussing this strange find, and came to no conclusion until the other fellow with us said \\\"May be Bigfoot did it\\\". I had heard something about Bigfoot, but never really paid any attention to what I had heard. He continued to tell us what he had heard about Bigfoot and succeeded in getting us so nervous that we got in the car and left. We talked about this all the way home. There was absolutely no reason for anyone to be in that area at that time of year, and how would they have gotten down to our camping sight without using the same route we had used? The other fellow with us said we should tell somebody about what we had found. I said I wasn't so sure, that we would probably all be locked up in the nut house. So we said nothing, at least for 10 days. I just drove me crazy. It was all I could think of, and finally I decided to write a letter to the Sheriff of Skamania County. Two or three days later, the front page of The Columbian newspaper was covered with a large picture of the \\\"cast\\\" the Sheriff had made and a story relating the letter I had sent the Sheriff. The prints measured 22 inches long, 7 1/2\\\" wide, and 4 1/2\\\" at the heel. By the time the Sheriff investigated my report, the footprints that I had found were pretty well \\\"washed\\\" out from melting and rain....but, the Sheriff and his boys found MORE prints beyond our campsite...2 different sets (the second set was smaller). The Sheriff used sulfur to make the casts because he said plaster tended to melt the snow. As far as I know, these casts are still in the Skamania County Sheriff's safe. After finding the footprints, and learning all we could about Bigfoot, we were a little apprehensive about going camping at Bear Creek. We finally decided we had never seen anything or been bothered before, so we continued to camp there the following Spring and Summer.

I guess to provide stability or drainage in the wet climate. This caught my attention. This large creature then set out across the meadow toward the river with long \\\"keep on trucking\\\" strides. It was huge. There were cows in the pasture and it walked between a few of them and it seemed as if the cows only came about 1/2 way up its body.

I thought it was a dog at first but closer examination ruled that out. We weren't really close so I had to do a little calculating, but the size of him between the cows and the 2 strides up the railroad bed made me think \\\"bigfoot\\\". He went to a little tributary of the river and squatted down for a while. I thought he was looking for salmon. I lost him for a while then he returned across the meadow.

I served as a US Army Infantry Sergeant at Ft.Lewis Wa. for several years, I am also an alpine climber. I went to Mt Adams most of the time because it was much more private than other mountains ie: St Helens, Rainer -- to many people. I also loved the thousands of acres of wilderness area which was restricted to six or eight hearts per group and no vehicles. Another Sergeant named Jim Avila, my climbing partner, and good friend, and his Golden Retriever pup were there also. We were only camping and hiking around this trip, since we had the puppy with us, normally we would have camped on a snowfield above the tree line. Just after nightfall we were talking and the puppy was next to the fire. The sky was crystal clear and everything \\\"felt\\\" normal. Since I spent six months out of the year living in the woods, and deserts of the western US and Europe, in the Army, the night is my ally--- I am an expert at what normal feels like. I needed to urinate, so I stood up and walked to my right rear about 20 feet where a path led down to a stream, I could hear and see the slow moving shallow water in this shallow pea gravel bedded creek, I did my thing and returned to the fire. We then decided to have some fun and see if we could get a coyote to howl, although we were not sure if any may have been around. We started our best howls to no avail. We continued for about five min. and then stopped. About and hour passed since my previous trip to urinate and I figured I would go again before getting in the sleeping bag. Jim was across from the fire and could see my walking toward the spot overlooking the path to the creek where I intended to void my bladder, HA HA. As my feet stopped I could hear footsteps in the dry gravel on the other side of the creek bed about 20' away. When It heard me stop, it stopped a little to late and I heard it. I felt intelligence in it's movement, not instinct, it knew it had been busted and just froze. I froze and drew my pistol Jim saw this and at the same time said the puppy flew into the cab of the truck. Jim, also sensing something wrong, drew his pistol, and stood up. I was looking right where this guy was standing but could not see him because he was across the water but still in front of the opposite bank, he was still frozen like a ROCK. Jim came to back me up he did not know what in the hell was going on and instead of telling him to stop I just kept my eyes glued to the spot I knew the guy was at and he finally decided to move out.He took two strides up the bank away from me with a look over his right shoulder as he was moving away to the right. His look was concern mixed with a child like fear, as if he really wanted to introduce himself in some way to our \\\"wolf-calling group\\\", Also puzzled like \\\"why are you indiots calling coyotes?----Your Humans, Stupid!\\\". The most animal like trait was a sort of a very brief mock anger face, which looked like an after-thought just before the big guy went into the woods. I looked at Jim --- no words --- we threw most of our stuff in the truck and left in a big hurry. There was no way I was staying in those woods that night. The big guy was huge, but slender as I recall. Don't ask me how, but I know he was an adolesent. He was sort of like a big kid, but moved like the wind. He saw my eyes and I saw his. I did not tell Jim what I saw, I never did. I never had to. Please belive me, I swear this account to be true.

We arrived at our camp spot and set everything up. We were camping next to a large dried up creek bed and I remember looking at it and following it a little ways down. Picking huckleberries and exploring the rest of the area, I spent the rest of my day just having fun. That night, after I and my friend and Dad had gone to bed, we were awakened by a stampede of deer or elk or something. There were at least 10 because it lasted about 20 to 30 seconds and they were running right through our camp. Scared the hell out of me. I remember my Dad getting up and making sure we were all right. Everything was fine and so I slowly fell back asleep. Next morning I woke up and looked around and it looked like some of our cooking gear was scattered about the camp, probably from the stampede running right through. And then I saw it what makes me believe in Bigfoot. There in the dried creek bed was a huge footprint. And i'm not talking about a human print. Though this foot print could have been made by a man, it was way too big and wide. I estimate a size 20 and it was like 4 to 5 inches across. Huge foot print. Scared me half to death.

The sound was between 800 to 1000 meters from our camp.  In this same area on a following trip that fall we found some partial tracks in a mud bank. They were just the toes and part of the ball of the foot. The track was approximately 7-8\\\" wide, I noticed that the great toe was disproportionately large (wide) in relationship to the other digits. The reason we noticed the track initially was not because it was so large (which we discovered on closer inspection) it was because there was patchy snow on the ground, it was raining, quit chilly, and here someone had be out in the middle of nowhere walking around bare footed. The tracks went up a muddy bank and were very distinct. I take it that they were very fresh. At the top of the muddy bank the track intersected a game trail.

St. Helens area last summer (June 98) when Dad pulled over at a washed out creek up past the Lava Canyon to video tape the creek where the explosion from the St. Helens blast washed out the creek. He was video taping on a small bridge where the road crosses the creek, narrating what he was seeing. He said, while standing there taping, he could hear beating of stick on wood from the forest to the left and a return pounding from the stand of trees to the right. He progressed further onto the bridge to hear for sure that it was not an echo, which he was very confident it was not. Further, since it was midday on a weekday, traffic in the area was none existant and no people had been seen for miles around. Nor were there any electrical lines or etc. in the area, nor work crews, nor loggers, nor hikers that would have been making these noises. My father is not easily scared, I mean that, and he was worried a bit about his safety at this point because of his certainty that the two separate noises were being generated in communication with one another, (left then right, then left at random spaces not exceeding moments apart). He had the video camera rolling throughout the experience and when I reviewed it the pounding noises of wood on wood are audible on the tape, if somewhat indiscernable. I then interviewed my Dad on my camera that evening to document the occaision. I might add that he said the stick being used to pound the trees or whatever was a heavy (thick) stick that made a deeper sound than the crack of a small stick would make, (hinting that the size of whom ever were pounding must be considerable). Dad stopped rolling tape and got back in the idling truck fearing for his further safety. We have a copy of the tape he made and the interview I made.

We went out to do some fishing and scouting for the upcoming elk season. Eventually we stopped at a large meadow to look for sign. As I was cutting back and forth through the meadow I spotted a scat I did not recognize. Nearby, perhaps thirty feet away, I spotted another scat of the same type. As I looked at the second I spotted a third, located fairly close to the second. All the scats appeared to be fresh. The scats were large, about five inches or so in diameter, but not the form or color of any large mammal scat that I knew.  They seemed to be composed of finely ground plant material. As I examined the third scat I suddenly realized that what appeared to be a large, humanlike, footprint was next to the third scat. I started yelling for my cousin. He never did hear me, but I finally saw him and waved him over. When he arrived I pointed to the third scat without saying a word. Before he even came to a stop he said, \\\"I don't know what it is.\\\" Then I pointed to the footprint, again without saying anything. He pressed his lips tightly together as he examined it, then simply looked at me and nodded. J., my son, and one of my cousin's sons, B., both thirteen, were playing back near the vehicle. When they saw the footprint they instantly accused us of trying to play a trick on them. Their joking assessment of the scat was that it was from B's older brother. It did look somewhat humanlike. We were pressed for time; the afternoon was supposed to be spent in Portland doing some shopping and sight-seeing with our wives and kids. I took a couple of pictures and collected the scats. We put them in the freezer when we arrived back at my cousin's house. The pictures were developed that night, but they did not turn out very well. Track details, in particular, were washed out  The track was two of my cousin's hand spans in length, about sixteen inches. Upon arriving back home in Oklahoma City, on Saturday, I began to search the Internet for Sasquatch-related sites. I found the BFRO and submitted a report. We requested confidentiality, which is why the report was not posted. We did get a lot of follow-up from researchers. I was in contact with several researchers via email, but my cousin was contacted personally and by phone.  As I understand things, the scats were shown to wildlife faculty, but no guess as to their identity was ventured. The last word we had on our observations was that they were from an area of high interest to the BFRO, and that there were plans to study the area more intensely in the future.\", \"location_details\": \"I'm sorry I don't have a specific distance - it was about ten miles north of a little store named (something like) Eagle's Cliff\", \"county\": \"Skamania County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 1766: Family finds track and scat pile while hiking southeast of Mt.

I had seen considerable elk activity about 1/2 mile from the meadows headed toward Lone Butte, on the north side of FR 30. J.W. killed an elk the year that this occurred so he could tell you for certain which year is was, I believe it was '98. At the lowest spot on FR 30  is a creek bottom. That year the creek was dry as it was a very dry year. The creek bottom made an excellent travel route in and out of the woods because it is sand and large rock bottomed. I went into the area before dawn and sett up about 300-400 yards off FR 30 in the creek bottom. Just after it was light enough to see, I heard a commotion coming from the brush alongside a well used trail that crosses the creek and enters a meadow about 200 yards from the creek. It sounded like acouple of bulls fighting and I moved as close as I could along the creek bottom. I waited for the elk to appear, then realized that the sound was stationary. I knew that I could not leave the creek bottom without making alot of noise so I waited. After about ten minutes the sound stopped. Thinking that it must have been a bull elk tearing up a tree, I returned to camp and retrieved my tree stand. Without disturbing the area where the \\\"elk\\\" had been, I found a suitable tree a short distance from the creek bottom and placed my tree stand, I did make considerable noise sawing limbs and such but kept the disturbance to a minimum and left for lunch. That evening I hunted another area to let my disturbance \\\"wear off\\\" but returned the next afternoon ready to sit the stand until dark. Shortly after getting into the tree the wind shifted from the NE to blowing out of the south, blowing my scent north toward Big Creek canyon. About 5:30pm I heard brush breaking behind and to my left (WNW). The animal seemed to be approaching on the trail that crossed the creek and ran almost directly beneath my stand. Abruptly the sound stopped as the animal hit my scent, I presume. At this time I was still thinking the animal was an elk and was prepared for a shot. The next sound of brush breaking came from the north as the animal circled my position. From the sound, the animal was about 50-60 yards away, just out of sight due to the lower limbs of adjacent trees. At this point, the animal began to emit a \\\"whooping\\\" sound which started very low and smoothly rose in pitch, stopping abruptly on a high pitched note. Each of these sounds was between two and three seconds long and each was identical to the last. It made the sounds about every 20 degrees as it circled me for an arc of about 140 degrees running from NW through ENE. I tried to believe that the sound was emitted by an elk but I have been archery hunting elk for over twenty years and have spent hours in close proximity, often close enough to hear their teeth pop, and I have never heard an elk make this sound before or since. The range was too great and the sound too loud to have been created by a human. It reminded me of Howler Monkeys only on a gargantuan scale with a much lower, deeper starting note. Two days before this event, I found a track along a creek in a spot that was hard to access and not at all a good place to \\\"hoax\\\" a track. It was very convincing and common to the photos and molds of tracks that I have seen. Because I had seen the track (about five miles from the tree stand) and because I happended to have been reading a book on Bigfoot encounters, I was not at all frightened by the encounter and decided to descend from my perch in order to have a better view beneath the canopy of the surrounding trees. I sat on a stump and glassed the area that I had last heard the animal but saw nothing. I left the area with enough daylight to reach my vehicle before full dark (okay, I'm not that brave). Just before I left I noticed an apple that I had accidently dropped from my stand earlier so I collected it and another that I had in my pack and left them on the stump at the base of the tree. I did not return to the stand until I retrieved it the day that we broke camp. The apples were gone but any animal or bird my have made off with them. I did look over the area where the tree thrashing noise came from on the first day but did not find the typical thrashed Christmas tree sized fir that an elk will work over. I believe that the thrashing I heard the first day my also have been a Yeti warning me of his presence. I do not pretend to know for certain what made the sounds, but the tape that you e-mailed to J.W. was remarkably similar except that the call was longer and sounded calmer.

My uncle and my two brothers and I went up to Mt. St. Helens to look for Bigfoot.  My uncle saw a print back in the 60's and has been talking about it all my life. He is getting older now and this was our first trip to go and look as a group.  He has studied Sasquatch for the last 30 years. We drove up Windy Ridge RD from the town Randle all the way to the top overlooking Spirit Lake , The weather was really bad it was raining and sleeting on and off and very foggy and windy.  The parking lot at the top was covered in a inch of slush.  The view was obscured  by a large cloud(like looking into a fog bank). We started driving back down the mountain below the level of the clouds and we stopped at the Cascade Mtn. viewpoint where there is a modular building and a Forest Service Road(2560) with a locked gate. I stopped the car and was mounting  a lens on my camera ; my brothers got out of the car to strech their legs and scan the hills ; my uncle was in the back seat of the car with a spotting scope looking down into meadow to the northeast. My little brother got out of the car and went to the edge of the valley and let out a \\\"HELLO!\\\" I told him to shut up and not to do that again.  But then from the backseat my uncle said that the scream from my brother had spooked something  down in the meadow and it was bolting around a hill in the middle of valley going from left to right and out of sight around a small hill about 400 yds. away he discribed it as large, black and walking upright.  My uncle was too scared to get out of the car, he said  \\\"us\\\" brothers should \\\"go and have a look\\\" up the road to see if we could get a better vantage point. The three of us proceeded to walk up the gated road ( FSRD 2560) leading up a ridge with some smaller knolls that ring the meadow.  It took us the most of 25 minutes up and down  the road and ten minutes scanning the meadow. My brothers and I didn't see it walking off from the vantage point where we where.  So we headed  back to the car. My Uncle Mac was in the car the whole time watching the area where he had spotted it the first time when we left up the road.  He said that after the three of us rounded the hill and where out of sight the large sasquatch walked back into his view left to right and proceeded back to where it was before, walking by a small black stump when that stump then stood up and walked off with it leading what must have been young in the opposite direction the three of us where going. He said he lost sight of it as they walked north down deeper into Bear Meadow. We all loaded into the car and drove a little down the mountain ( 1/2 miles) to the Miner's Car at a parking lot that is near the southern side of Bismark Mtn.  Clearwater Creek runs out of Meta Lake and under Windy River Rd. and into Bear Meadow at the Miner's Car.  My uncle and my brothers spread out along the road to see if they could tell where these things where crossing the road.  I walked down the creekbed from the road into a slight gulley and followed it for about 100 yrds on the left side staying near the lowest point  along a game trail when I came up on a broken tree that had been broken for at least a year( Brown needles at the top).  I found a large humanoid footprint on a slope next to the tree. The toes where very noticable (no claws) and where imprinted in mud.  I went back to the car to get plaster and the consultation of my older brother who went to WSU and studied under Dr. Krantz.  I showed him the print before we poured the cast,  he agreed with me that it must be a bigfoot print .  I reminded him that we where in the blast area and no one normally walks in this restricted area on the side of a volcano barefoot .

The ridge was not part of the climbing route and access to it required a steep downclimb then up steeply. And since visibility was excellent, so there was no plausable reason for anyone to be over there. It was not an elk or coyote, and did not sound like a dog. The ridge was snow covered with just a few small trees and rocks poking through. I looked closely for signs for movement, but saw none. I told my friends half-jokingly, maybe it was Bigfoot!  They laughed, but I wondered. I listened to the Bigfoot Scream 1978 Snohomish recording and yes, indeed, it sounded exactly like that!

We decided to camp out two nights (starting Friday) at the Tillicum campsite which was about 4 miles from Skookum, hike into Skookum Saturday, and then leave Sunday morning. All three of us were sharing a four man tent and after going to bed Friday night, I was awoken by A.S. who mentioned that there were strange sounds outside. At that point all three of us were lying there awake. The first sound that I heard sounded just like coyotes but then I heard a weird gutteral growl like sound (which in all truth kind of gave me the shivers). That was the last sound I heard and before going back to sleep I remember commenting aloud \\\"weird\\\". The next morning before going out on the hike we talked briefly about the sounds and A.S. mentioned that before the coyote sounds there were some stranger sounds that had woke him up (more about this and the other sounds later). On the hike down trail 21 we found some deer trails that per A.S.'s GPS system looked like they went down do Skookum. We decided to follow the trail and maybe an eighth of a mile down the trail A.S. got excited and pointed to what could have been prints.  The prints were vague but did appear to be somewhat human shaped with possible toe and hill prints (the ground was fairly firm and the prints did not look fresh). I would say that the prints looked like size 12 or 13 feet. The prints also appeared to go down the trail and there were possibly 4 or 6 that we could make out. Since the prints were pretty vague it would have been impossible to make casts and we decided that the pictures probably wouldn't come out well (now I wish that we had). For the rest of the trip we didn't see or hear anything strange. After the trip we discussed the prints more and of the three of us, D.G. appeared convinced that the prints were the real thing, I was fairly neutral giving them about a 50% chance of being the real thing (I would like to have higher confidence but I was worried that we could be biased in that we \\\"really\\\" wanted to see something) and A.S. who had been the first to see them and initially very excited pretty much talked himself out of thinking they were anything of importance BUT he kept mentioning those weird sounds we heard the first night and how he thought they might have been something. I didn't think too much about the sounds besides doing my rendition of them for my wife, brother, and sons until the night of Friday August 17th. Up until that time the main reason why I didn't pay them as much attention as I later would is that they didn't sound like the sounds available on the BFRO website. That all changed on the 17th though when I was getting ready to put a movie in the VCR and noticed that \\\"Encounters with the Unexplained\\\" on the PAX channel had a special on Sasquatch.  After watching for about three minutes, they played supposed bigfoot sounds and several of them WERE JUST LIKE THE ONES I/WE HEARD!! My wife who was in the next room unpacking heard the same sounds on the tv and noticing how similar they were to my renditions made a comment as to whether or not those were the same I heard. In that instant when I heard those sounds on TV I decided that we had heard a bigfoot and for about the next half an hour I had goosebumps going up and down my body (my wife was shocked/amused about how shaken up/freaked out I was). On Sunday I called A.S. up (he had been away for the weekend) and questioned him more about the sounds that had originally woken him up. He said that he had first heard a long moaning like sound followed by a loud wail which was followed by the coyote and other sounds which I had also heard.  We decided that we might as well submit this report to BFRO and after talking with D.G. he also agreed.

I have been in the process of writing a book on Ape Cave near Mt St Helens. I contacted Jeff Lemley about getting some reports about Bigfoot stories to add to my book. I have kept in close contact with Jeff since the first contact and emailed him immediately after we got back from our trip. I told my husband, Larry, that I wanted to go camping at Peterson Prairie for my birthday (August 15th) with my twin sister, Vicki and her husband, Jim K. I thought it would be fun to take in a cave or two, time permitting. My husband and I are avid cavers and enjoy spending free time exploring the wild caves of Southern Washington State near Mt St Helens and Mt Adams. We both felt it would be a good time to introduce my sister and her husband (and their toy red Poodle, Sparky) to the sport of wild caving. The four of us drove our two minivans through the Dark Divide and arrived at camp late in the day on the 14th. Our favorite camp spot was still available so we proceeded to set up camp. As it turned out, my sister and her husband, took the safe way out and set up camp in their Dodge Caravan, while I pitched our miniscule backpacking tent 50 feet South of the camp in a small clearing surrounding by small pines. It was just enough room to pitch a small tent and still be able to tie off the guy ropes to keep the rainfly away from the tent. As far as I knew, the night was uneventful until my husband spoke up the next morning. Larry told all of us that he thought he heard a Bigfoot howling (my husband is an extreme skeptic when it comes to anything related to Bigfoot). We all talked about it for a while and then decided to get ready to go caving in Cheese Cave, a local lava tube. Later in the day, we rode our bikes to some local caves and then went back to camp. Later, Larry and I left my sister and her husband at camp to rest while we set out to find Dynamite Cave. We drove around all of the dirt roads in the STR that we thought it was supposed to be located in. We parked the van at several locations. At one spot, my husband started walking down a remote trail with me following a short distance behind him. I stopped on the trail not far from the car because I heard something very large run through the bush to my right, just off the trail. My husband kept going, but I was too apprehensive to move. Whatever it was, it was huge; but it didn't sound like an elk moving through the bush. Also, I felt like something was watching me. It was quite creepy! Since Larry had moved out of sight, I felt very vunerable and literally ran up to catch up with him. I kept telling him I wanted to go back to the car; but didn't want to go by the one spot alone. He finally relented and we walking briskly to the car. That night we all walked to the clearing due East of camp, next to the road which led to the group camp to watch the stars and anything else interesting in the clear skies. After turning in about 10PM, we slept soundly until about 3AM, when I was awakened by an incredibly loud howling, unlike anything I had ever heard in my life. Since I am an avid outdoorsperson, I have camped out and seen and heard most of the wild things that occur in the forests and mountains. This was like nothing I had ever heard before. There was absolutely no other sounds from the forest until a Barred Owl responded to the howl. I woke Larry up to ask him about the howls. He said that it was the very same thing that he heard the night before. We both listened to it banter back and forth with the owl. After maybe 10 to 15 minutes of howling, the owl took off flying North through the trees. We could both hear his wings flapping as he was hooting. He was much closer to us than the thing which was howling; but the howling was much louder than the owl. What happened next sent chills down my spine. I was laying on my stomach in the tent, needing very much to go outside and relieve myself; but unwilling to venture outside due to the howlings I was still listening to. Larry had fallen back asleep, so unfortunately, the thing I heard next fell on my ears alone. The best I could describe it was a howling turning into an Ape-like chattering. It sounded like someone was practicing phonics by contorting their mouth, while at the same time, reciting all the vowels. That is the best I can describe it. The sounds were incredibly loud and quite frightening sounding. I lay motionless until the sounds died down and I fell asleep. I was awakened one more time around 6:15 to 6:30 in the morning. Light was already finding its way into camp which I could see through the mosquito netting at the head of our tent. This time I heard a pack of coyotes start up, followed again by that same howling sound. At this point, I was really getting freaked out; but was still not willing to venture out of the tent. As soon as it was light enough, I got up and ran to my sister's van. I rapped on their window and asked if they heard the howls. Of course, they hadn't heard anything; but were quite interested in what Larry and I had heard that night. When I got home, I emailed Jeff Lemley to see if he had any wave files to listen to that might sound like what we heard. I listened to every owl sound on the web and nothing sounded like what we heard. A few days later, I got an email from Jeff about the other report four days before ours, only 6 miles North of us. As I told Jeff, both my husband and I would like to think that the sounds we heard were in fact, Barred Owls. Anyone sleeping in a flimsy nylon tent would probably convince themselves of the same.

A couple of things about the animal. 1.  It was totally black, like a black bear. It had no facial features that we could detect at all. It didn't appear to have a nose, eyes, mouth or anything, that we could see from the 100 yards we were away. 2.  The animal was in bright sunlight as it crossed the road - there was no mistaking it for a bear - and bears don't have 6 ft strides. 3. The animal appeared to be about 8-8.5 feet tall and slender build. It wasn't the massive muscular specimen I have thought they may be if they exist at all.

I had talked with Joe Beelart about this trip, because he had just returned from the area with a party of 10, including Peter Byrne, Todd Neiss, film crew and our own Al Berry and Ron Morehead. Joe talked me out of going there by myself because of the terrain and for safety reasons, so I altered my plans. I decided to divide this trip up into three parts\\u2026 doing some things and going some places I had been meaning to for a long time. Skookum Meadows revisit, Estacada and the Wynooche river drainage.  I usually make trips like this in search of areas to investigate for longer periods of time at later dates. I do these scouting trips mostly alone and try to cram as much as possible into them.  Oct 19 \\u2013 Met with Jeff Lemley and his brother around 10:00PM in the Skookum Meadows area to do some late night call blasting. By the time I got there they had already tried a couple of sets. It was quite foggy, but the sound still carried well, with echoes lasting a few seconds after the source stopped. This is the best time to blast out these sounds, late evening, early morning in the fog since the air is quite dense at this time. Interestingly enough, the primates that do use long type calls for communications between members also choose this time of the day to do so.  Jeff and Alan Terry have built themselves quite an impressive sound blasting system. It is modular and has very good output. The sound was clear, I heard no distortion or feedback during the blasts he made. It ran off his car battery. I was quite tired and didn\\u2019t last too long sitting outside with Jeff and company in the cold, I crawled back into my truck around 11:30PM and quickly fell asleep. My day job work shift gets me out of bed at 2:30AM and I usually work 10 hour days. I was starting this out all wrong.  Jeff woke me around midnight and said that they were going back home and that they had heard nothing while I was sleeping. I thanked them for meeting with me and bringing the equipment. I watched them leave. I quickly went back to sleep.  Oct 20 \\u2013 I woke at my usual time \\u2013 2:30AM (great!) and started to drive the back roads, visiting the Skookum Meadows Expedition base camp, hill top and ridge top sites as well as the cast site. I wanted to take some measurements, get another average GPS reading after the military eliminated the scramble signal at the cast site and just have a look at the general area during hunting season.  One deer and a lone coyote, evidenced by their tracks had visited the cast site. I collected a soil sample, documented the cast site with pictures, GPS and did some tape measurements.  I found some interesting things traveling around the area this trip:  \\u00b7 A skid mark, looking very much like a human buttock on a road side bank, complete with what might have been hand prints and three impressions that hinted at being bare footprints \\u2013 16.5\\u201d long x 6\\u201d wide at the ball and with toes. \\u00b7 At the exact spot where, during the expedition, I had been filmed looking at some heat tracks on the road with the thermal imager and where I cut open a melon fruit, I found a bee hive, broken in two. It was a natural hive. I couldn't think of why a bear would carry a hive around like this only to suck on it out in the open on a dirt road. There were more large human shaped tracks leading down the road side embankment nearby. \\u00b7 Along the roads, on the side banks, I found 20\\u2019 \\u2013 25\\u2019 fir trees growing half way up. Large human shaped tracks led up to a spot behind these trees and then back down to the road. Some stomping around behind the trees was evident. This lead me to envision something treking up these small slopes, evading night time drivers, returning to the roadway only after passing. \\u00b7 Someone had been leaving fruit...

Since there were no other campers within miles of us I figured it was deer or some other critter they were barking at. It was after midnight and was quite dark the fire was down to coals. I got this intense feeling that I was not alone, I put it down as over active imagination that feeling you get when you are alone but feel like someone is watching you, so I decided to head for the tent. Some time in the morning between 3:00am and 4:00am I was awakened by what I thought was coyotes howling. It was high pitched. It was not loud at first but grew in intensity, it awakened my wife also, it sounded like one than others joining in. It sounded like five or six animals as it grew in intensity. I knew it was not anything I had heard before. I jumped up thinking it was an alarm and that the woods were on fire but the night was dark and no smoke so we listened to it and could tell it was some sort of animals. I thought it was elk my wife and sister inlaw had spotted a heard down the road earlier that day but I have never heard elk sound like this and if it was they were in pain, as I said it started out low and others joined in and it grew in intensity like it was far away and getting closer it lasted about 10 maybe 15 seconds and then just stop abruptly! It was in unison starting with one than another until it sounded like 5 or 6 going at the same time and then just stopped all at once. It was a very high pitched scream, not a trumpet like an elk or the squeek of a deer and it was not the cry of a cougar. I have heard these animals before and this was new to me.

We entered the woods to the east of the campground. We used flashlights to light our way and I was in lead and went towards the noise. It seemed fairly close to us. By this time the screams had gone on for 5-10 minutes already. As we drew near the noise, which was emanating approx 200-300 ft from the perimeter of the campground, we smelled a foul smell. It smelled like animal droppings mixed with other odors. The forest around us sounded very loud with brush movement and cracking wood.

It was during the Washington bow season for elk. As I was heading in I ran into two hunters on the trail hunting down to their vehicle to dry out and stay in their camper. They told me that a group had been hunting in the area but had to leave because there horses were acting up. As I got to the lake I could tell that the horses had been kept in a small meadow near the campsite area. I pitched my tent in this area. I was at the lake doing a little fishing before dark when I heard a howl way off in the distance. I didn't think much of it, it was miles away. There were also several bull elk bugling in the hills behind the lake and at one point I could hear some cow elk \\\"talking\\\". Being an elk hunter myself, I am very familiar with the sounds elk make during this time of year. That was one of the reasons I had gone to this area was to try to call in and get pictures of the elk. As night fell I stayed up until approximately 9:00 PM listening to the sounds of the woods. I could hear a couple owls hooting back and forth across the lake as I fell asleep. At 11:24 PM I was awoken by the same screaming howl I had heard before but it sounded like it was coming from the meadow I was camped next to, about 50 yards away. It sounded like a cross between a wolf and a very loud human. It sounded as if it were a hailing call. I opened the front flap of the tent and grabbed my light and the only weapon I had, my knife. I also grabbed the camera just in case I could see something. The howl had also scared the two owls I had heard hooting earlier that evening. The owls continued to call back and forth to each other for a time after that but I never heard the howl again.

With that said, I would like to share with you folks my experience this fall during the 2008 late muzzle loading hunt in Washington state. I saw two different set tracks On two separate days, in different areas of the wind river hunting unit. The below single track was well defined and very recent, as the grass was still coming out of the print whilst I observed it. If I had to guess the print was about 13 to 14 inches long with no instep, five toes and I marveled at how big the big toe was. Anatomically correct in relation to the other toes. Depth was about 3/4 of an inch into the ground. I was well away from the fire roads and still hunting in loops to keep the wind in our favor and to do a complete stalk of the habitat. As I still hunt at a glacial pace I see a lot of game and don't hardly ever disturb the wild life I'm hunting through. I wear dark wool clothes and use the primitive equipment of the fur trade era. My son and I both closely studied the print. I could see less defined impressions leading away by laying on the ground sighting in the direction of travel. As the ground was in a semi frozen state that was softening up after an previous evening of light rain. This was a single print in a remote area well away from the fire roads.

I was in the south prairie area on the north end of the lava flow. As I had seen a cow and a calf tracks in a area south and east of the area we were in, we planned to return to a  different spot via a circuitous route using the available cover and watch a park like area that isn't easily viewed for the evening hunt. This overlooked a sandy area that was the result of flooding outflow. Laying down a volcanic pumice like sand. I was keeping track of the tracks that went up and down the temporary water bed as it effectively cut the prairie in half making it convenient to get a \\\"snapshot\\\" of the previous evenings events. These were all marked and noted each morning when in the area. I was narrowing my hunt down to these two animals. That evening, while looking over the prairie and glassing the adjacent treeline from the cover of a large tree, I heard a knock or thwack about 150 yards out (Since I was elk hunting I thought it was an antler strike). This was about 10 minutes before the end of legal shooting light as I keep close track of my time when finishing out the day's hunt. Optimistic about the next day's scenario already, we headed for the truck assisted with flashlights. Which we did not turn on until we were well away from this spot as we intended to be back in the morning before day break. We also used the available trees and cover to mask our departure as well. Next morning, we returned and set up on the previous evenings spot. After the sun was well up I and my son went out on to the prairie to check the sandy wash for sign. This is where we saw three distinct tracks, one in the sand then two deeper ones about 80 inches apart with the last easily defined print on the other side of an log that I could tell, didn't even break it's stride for. These were identical to yesterdays tracks, size, depth shape etc. I feel that it was the same animal. There are numerous other details, conjecture etc, that I would be happy to discuss now that I am no longer in denial! I am hopeful that this information is of some small help.

I asked if we could continue walking. Maybe another 75-100 feet walking through the meadow parallel with the road she had asked if she could practice her bigfoot calls, sure I thought, midday, perfect to practice. She had let off 3 quick calls and we waited for maybe a minute before we kept walking. Then she came upon the ants. These ants were having a war, but I was too busy thinking of that bear I might run into and wanted to keep walking. But instead took the opportunity to just look. Just look at my surroundings. I was staring off into the treeline for a minute or two, when through the trees I saw something big and fast move from my left to right without making any noise. In that short amount of time, I am fairly certain that I had seen a hand. But it was mostly the texture of the hair that struck me.

The screaming was across the Stillaguamish River which was about 50 meters from where we slept and into the forest on the other side.  Across the river was a steep incline into the rustic forest and beyond that was nothing but wilderness all the way into Canada.  The screaming became louder and louder as the \\u201cthing\\u201d that was screaming was getting closer.  I heard it walking down the steep hill on the other side of the river, and then I heard it walk up and down the other side of the river, screaming all the more.  It was very loud and very scary.  It gave me the impression that it was angry.  Angry at us for being in its area and it wanted us out.  That was my impression.  I was scared to death and I did not know what to do.  Then, suddenly, the thing walked across the river towards me!  It came to my side of the river and began to walk up and down the river bank screaming all the louder.  Then it stepped on a fallen tree that was on the river bank and I heard a \\u201csnap\\u201d as the weight of the thing broke the log as it stepped on it.  Then the thing walked up to me and my friends and came within 10 feet of us and screamed some more.  I thought it was going to kill us.  Just then I noticed the terrible odor that this thing had.  It was overwhelming!  It was so strong it made my eyes water.  I was petrified.  I was too scared to move, to speak, to do anything.  I really thought it was going to kill me.  It was lasting forever!  This thing was standing over top of me, screaming, smelling horrible, and scaring me to death.  Then he started to simply walk away.  It went back to the river and walked across it to the other side.  Then it climbed up the steep hill and into the forest screaming all the time.  The screams became farther and farther away.  When it was a good distance away I started to believe that it wasn\\u2019t going to kill me.  I then asked my friends, \\u201cTom, Byron, Jay, did you guys hear that\\u201d?

Several times the sled would tip over and they would stop while his son put it back on the road. When Mr. Becker asked him to put it in the middle he said there was a pile of droppings there. Mr. Becker took a look and noticed that the droppings were from a wild animal, but did not think anything of it until later. They began pulling the sled up the road again. On the next stop they noticed a trail of large footprints going up the bank. They went over for a closer look and discovered that they were just like human's bare footprints with 5 toes. It suddenly came to Mr. Becker that this could be the legendary 'bigfoot' that he had read about on several occasions. He kept the kids back so as not to disturb the tracks. He then put his foot in one of the tracks for comparison. He had on a pair of heavy snow boots and there was an inch difference on each side and 2 or 3 inches at the front and back. He spread his legs out next to the tracks to compare the stride. He said he practically had to do the splits to match the stride: which would be about 4 to 5 feet between steps. A couple of prints were pushed all the way to the ground under the snow. With his weight, even jumping up and down, he could not sink half that far. He thought of the pile of droppings and figured it could have come from what ever made the tracks. He thought the tracks were from 1 to 2 days old at the most. It was getting late in the afternoon and starting to drizzle so he decided to take the kids home and come back another day and get some pictures and possibly follow the tracks to see where they led.

The familiar ascent had been particularly interesting in that we passed a herd of mountain goat with young that were grazing in the cirque meadow. We had also seen several marmots.

We had descended through the Pass and were picking our way through boulders about halfway down the cirque when I turned and looked back up to where we had been a few minutes earlier. I noticed movement in the Pass. A large, dark, human-like form stood up and looked directly down at us. I stopped and asked my partner who was ahead of me, \\\"What's that figure up in the Pass?\\\" Neither of us spoke as we watched the form. The situation was very odd because we knew there was no one else on the upper mountain. Familiarity with the area and subsequent research indicates that there are no other routes to the Pass. It would be impossible to miss other hikers on the narrow exposed trail, not to mention the fact that at the outset ours was the only vehicle parked at the trail head. As we watched, the form began to vigorously wave its unusually long arms up and down and over its head. On speaking later of this odd behavior both my partner and I had clearly interpreted it to mean, \\\"Get the hell out of here!\\\" as opposed to, \\\"Hello there.\\\" The gesture was definitely felt as menacing.

I did not see a Big Foot, but I may have seen evidence of one.  This happened over a year ago, about May of 1999.  It was not until a recent conversation with a person who knows a little about Big Foot traces, that it occurred to me that I might have seen the results of a Big Foot. I was working up at Canyon Park, in Bothell, WA, a corporate park that is in a region of rapid transition from country to suburban.  There are walking trails around the corporate park, and some are quite wooded.  I would walk one of these trails out for lunch each day; the trail can easily bee seen from the road and office buildings on one side.  A stream runs on the other side. One afternoon in May 1999, I came across a tree lying directly across the trail.  The diameter of the tree trunk was about 5 inches.  The tree was freshly snapped off and was about 25 feet long (a young tree).  At first I was confused, because it was fresh, not sawed but snapped.  I could not find where the original tree trunk was located.  It took me a couple of minutes to find the trunk.  The tree was snapped off about ten feet up, cleared from the trunk, and laying directly across the trail as to block it.  I was completely dumbfounded as how or who could have climbed up there, snapped it, and done that!  I brought out a friend from work the next day to look at it, and we both were completely perplexed.  It was a calm spring, and there were no winds even close to the strength it would take to snap that tree.  There were no markings on the ground to indicate vehicles or a cherry picker bumping into it; we looked.  Lastly, it did seem to be placed directly on the trail to block it. We pulled the tree over to unblock the trail. I was telling a friend about it not to long ago, it never occurred to me that it could have something to do with Big Foot.  It would have taken Herculean strength to break that tree, and there seems no logic to doing it around an uninhabited corporate park trail.  I never bothered to look for footprints. I bet the tree is still lying there.  At least the ten-foot tree trunk would still be there.  Sorry if this report is so cold; had I known what I was looking at, I might have looked for footprints or even perhaps could have checked for hair samples. What do you think?  Big Foot or just some big animal (Bear) or kids swinging in a tree?  It is a corporate park completely cut off from where kids play, so I doubt that.  Too massive for kids to break as well I think.

Immediately after the whistle, I heard more whistling in the same direction but from multiple sources. The whistling began to sound like small birds or birds chirping. Rob and I contemplated what kind of a bird would be in the mountains chirping at midnight in the middle of winter. We figured there are none. At about 12:15 I heard some fast paced foot steps beyond our field of vision. We viewed the area with our flashlights and I didn't see anything.

The back 10 acres was heavily forested with thick underbrush. I could hear something very large moving through the thick underbrush and downed alder trees. Large branches were breaking like twigs. While the sounds of the trees being snapped were happening loud roars and screams like I have never heard before or since were being vocalized. I yelled. There was no response, just the same noises happening. I did not want to walk into the swamp at that point.  I listened for about 10-15 minutes. The two dogs I owned that were very brave watch dogs just stood by my side, not wanting to investigate. This was odd in itself as they were very territorial. I remember them looking up at me with a look like \\\"were not going in there\\\". I went inside the house and told my girlfriend as I wanted her to come out and listen. She said if it was what I said it was she didn't want to go outside. We stayed in the house the rest of the night and I was not scared but very tingly on my skin and alert. The next day i walked into the swamp to try to see evidence of the creature. I didn't make it very far because of the mud up to my knees and thick russian thistles. My friend came over later that day around dusk. I told him of the encounter and he asked where it had happened. I walked him to the location. When we arrived the same thing happened as the day before. The creature was still there and I was just down in the swamp a few hours earlier and heard nothing. My friend listened for about five minutes. I asked him what he thought it was. he replied,\\\"I don't know Chuck-but good luck\\\". Then he hurried to his car and jumped in and left just leaving me standing there with this thing roaring. I went inside the house with it still there. I didn't feel like shooting it. It didn't pound on the house or anything like that. I never heard it again after that. I sold the 20 acres and the two houses within 6 months after the incident.

Loop Hwy with my best friend.  We decided to go for a late afternoon hike that we were familiar with, Heather Lake Trail.  In fact, that was our routine exercise spot because we knew it was safe.  Before I explain that incident, there is something else I need to share...we went up there on another occasion and noticed a really LARGE kind of hut off the trail.  It was somewhat difficult to get to due to the steep terrain.  I can't even recall how we even noticed it because it was so well-disguised.  It was enormous, though.  We made it down there and explored it:  heavy amount of broken branches covered over a hollowed out tree stump, roof made of fresh branches, tons of more branches on the floor that appeared to be matted as if it was slept on, entrance was covered by more branches.  I'm 5-03\\\" and it was high enough to be a 2-story home for a kid's playhouse... about 7ft high.  It was amazing, but very eerie because it was obvious that it was recently built and used.  Also, there was a stinky odor (wet dog).  Within a few minutes, Cyndi and I felt like we were being watched and left the hut right away to continue our hike.  We thought nothing of it after that- didn't suspect a bigfoot at all because that didn't cross our mind. The original story I wanted to share was one where Cyndi and I went up as the very last hikers on the trail that late afternoon.  A couple coming down warned us about it getting dark and being the last ones.  It takes about 45-50min to hike up and when we got up there, we turned around to head back down.  Before that, we both had to pee.  Cyndi went first and went behind some trees to squat.  She came out with a smurk on her face asking why I had been throwing rocks at her.  I denied doing so, but she didn't believe me even when I said I couldn't see her because I was doing last second site-seeing about 20 ft away.  Then I had to go pee and we switched places and just as I squatted a rock was thrown about my head and hit the tree I leaned against.  There was no way it was Cyndi because I knew she was behind me, not in front.  I freaked out and told Cyndi it must've been some creepy guy watching.  So, we started hollering out \\\"a**hole.\\\"   It was so silent up there and we can feel like we were being watched yet we knew we were the only ones up there.  I told Cyndi let's go now and we started walking really fast and then we started running.  Parallel to us running on the trail, we could hear/feel the ground stomping and branches breaking.  We freaked out and I grabbed Cyndi and we hid behind a tree off the trail.  The sounds of someone following us stopped.  Then, BAM!  Another rock gets thrown at us while in our hiding spot.  We started screaming and ran down that mountain I swear in 15 minutes.  Bloody scraped legs and wet clothes from sliding down the small water-filled rock beds, we got to our car and cried.  We didn't know who or what that was.  No joke, about 2 years later, I watch on TV a couple describing their face-to-face encounter with a big foot on Heather Lake Trail!  I called Cyndi and now I'm convinced that's what it was.

To make a long story short, while hiking in a very dense gorge between two mountains, we came across a nest. If you have never been to the wilderness of the Pacific Northwest, let me tell you - it is DENSE! I mean, there could be a hundred Bigfoots within twenty yards of you and you wouldn't see them. Ferns and other under growth are growing anywhere from waist to shoulder length, with absolutely towering trees every few feet - truely amazing. The nest was completely conceiled, and if I hadn't walked directly in front of the opening, I never would have even noticed it. The construction was unbelievable; the under growth was woven to form a about a seven foot tunnel leading to a larger doomed inner room, about the size of a mid-sized car. The tunnel leading to the room was perfectly round and had another bush pulled towards it to conceal the entrance. We went inside to look for evidence or smell, but could find neither. While investigating inside we both looked at each other, for no reason, and both of us suddenly became very spooked. We didn't see or hear anything, just knew we had to get the hell out of there and did. We were going to go back later, but the weather went to hell and was pouring down rain.

All of a sudden verything got real quiet. All the birds stopped singing. Then we heard a whooping noise. It started about 100 yards away above us on the hillside. We stopped and listened. The noise continued about every 2 minutes and got closer and closer. Once it got within about 30 yards away directly above us, it was really loud. We could smell something that was like a dirty wet dog smell. I pulled my sidearm. I did not remember ever hearing anything like this before and was concerned we were about to be attacked by something big. We sat waiting on the trail for about 5 minutes after the last noise. I was scanning the hillside above us but could not see or hear any movement. The birds started singing again and the smell went away.

We did not see anything so we went on up to the lake and had a good time. Once we got home I went to the BFRO site and listened to the sound recordings. One of them was exactly what we heard. The hairs on my neck stood up. What ever made that noise in the recording was what we heard. Also I thought the smell could be some type of plant that smelled like a dog and that was why it was called poodle dog pass.

She said it had hair covering its entire body and she noticed hair hanging from its arms.  She also heard from the swamp a whoop-whoop-whoop sound.  Thinking back she realizes that she had heard that sound coming from the swamp before, but thought it was some kind of bird.  It ran into an area of hundreds of wooded acres which eventually dip into the valley beyond (we are up on a plateau).  There is a ravine in the middle of this area.  To the right, past the swamp and as the crow flies there is Woods Creek about a mile or more away.  The deer pass by this area headed toward water at Woods Creek.

As we ran, the final HOOOOOOT!! came from behind us, streaking thru thigh high fieldgrass, I was sure that I was seconds away from having my arms ripped off by a mountain devil. I can laugh now about how I felt, but after talking with other friends who have had run-ins with Sasquach, the common thread in our experiences seems to be uncontrolable fear. Like being hunted. The dogs and I ran into the house, breathless and bug eyed with terror, I made my mother come out to the backyard where we listened for the noise.

I was employed with the US Forest Service in Skykomish, WA on the Mt. Baker Snoqualmie NF. I was part of a wildland firefighting crew on the Skykomish Ranger dist. I should point out that I grew up in mountainous regions and did lots of hunting and hiking all my life.  My father was a hunting guide when I was a young boy and I'm very familiar with all species of Northwest wildlife, tracks, sounds, smells, etc. On the night of the 22nd of July, the district encountered many lighting strikes. The following morning we (firefighters) met with officials to determine what areas were hit and to find out who would be going where. We split-up in teams of two. After reaching the end of the Beckler River drainage  I saw the smoke and the area of concern which was high on a steep, thick, north facing hillside.  Me and my partner geared up and started climbing the mountain. The terrain was VERY rugged, steep, rocky, and thick with Devil's Club & Salmon Berry brush.  After hiking approx 2 1/2 to 3 hours through this terrain, moving slow due to the steepness, we finally reached the fire.  We worked on the fire for about 2 hours then started our decent back our truck.  We took a slightly different route than the way we came up. We were about 200 yards down from where we had been working when my partner (Joe) slipped and dropped his shovel, it slid down the steep hill about 100 feet or so.  I offered to go down and get it for him.  When I climbed down to the shovel, it had landed on a rocky outcropping and I had to carefully scale the terrain to get down to the ledge. When I got the shovel, I noticed a small cave entrance that had brush surrounding it.  As soon as I got closer to inspect, I could smell a foul odor coming from inside.   I shined my light inside the cave and could tell it was larger inside.  I wasn't able to see how deep it went back with my light.  The odor kept me from going any further in. I had heard of the foul odor associated with bigfoots and immediatley became uncomfortable.  It was an overall eerie feeling. I yelled up to Joe that I had found a cave and it really stunk.  He seemed to just want to keep heading back to the truck so he continued down the path we were on before I climbed down for the shovel. I was looking down the mountain to see how I was going to get down off the ledge and connect with the trail we were on before.  As I was standing there, I saw out of the corner of my eye, a bowling ball-sized boulder came flying from over my head.  It crashed and rolled into a ravine about 10 or 15 yards downhill from me.  I yelled back up the hill to Joe, \\\"Did you throw that!!?\\\".  When he said \\\"No!!\\\", I realized that he had already walked away from where he had been and was now way to the left of my location. It was at that moment I realized that rock COULD NOT have been thrown by him, nor did it roll down the hill because I would have heard it crashing down from above me.  I then looked back uphill from where the rock had come from just in time to see ANOTHER rock coming from above me.  The second rock hit the ground more to the left and below me.  I was visually scanning the area where the rock had come from when I heard movement in the brush.  I crouched down and watched the area.  I then saw a dark, hairy figure walking upright along the side of the mountain, away from me.  It was always partially obscured by brush and trees so I couldn't really tell color or exact heighth, but I would guess about 7-9 ft. tall. I watched it for a few seconds then yelled to Joe \\\"I see it!\\\", I think I said \\\"I think it's a bigfoot!\\\".  As soon as I yelled that, I looked back up and it was dead still and silent.  I felt like it stopped and hid when I yelled because I didn't see or hear anything else. At this point I really wanted to get out of there so I side-hilled over to Joe and we quickly decended back to our vehicle.  We were both very freaked out and talked about it all the way back to the ranger station where we reported the incident to our wildlife biologist and other officials at the ranger district. I was later contacted by someone at the U of W who wanted to interview me and have me take him to the site.  I moved from the area shortly afterwards and I never took him there.

This is not uncommon in this area as some locals do hunt cougar and bear with hounds here. Although it is illegal to kill cougars they do \\\"tree\\\" them for sport. Later that evening around 5:00PM the same witness had gone down the bank by Bachman Creek to relieve himself and when he came back commented that something seemed a little strange and there was a different odor in the air down by the creek and felt a little \\\"creeped out\\\" by it. We started a campfire at about 7:30 PM. The campfire is located about 20 feet from the edge of a creek running through a sapling filled older riverbed. At 8:20 PM, as we sat around the fire conversing, a distinct, loud, and very close vocalization occurred that literally stunned us all into silence. There were two distinct parts to the sound and overall lasted only 15-20 seconds. The first part lasted about 12-15 seconds and consisted of a whooing/moaning that was very distinct and close, right at the far edge of the creek I would guess. Followed by a 2-5 second pause and then a booming, paralyzing scream that lasted about 5 seconds. The reactions within the group varied with two of us quickly putting the fire between us and whatever was making this sound, the others just sitting in silence. We immediately heard movement in the dark\\u2026not loud but obviously something moving from left to right on the far side of the creek (maybe 30 feet away). Then nothing. One of the witnesses who has lived, fished and hunted in this area for over 40 years swears he has never heard anything even close to this vocalization\\u2026and really does not want to again. The next day we found no obvious sign in the creek immediately out from the campfire. Leaves had started covering the ground so it would have been difficult to find any sign. The next day a friend and I hiked up the creek and river approximately \\u00bc-1/2 mile and found a fresh sapling broken/twisted off at about 10 ft. and the top section thrown out onto the rocks at the river edge about 15 ft away. At the river edge, in a sandy area we found barefoot prints\\u2026small, maybe 9\\u201d but with strange toes. Not human?

I\\u2019ve lived in WA my whole life and had in interest in crypto-zoology as a child but had never taken any mention of Bigfoot seriously until I had my encounter. I was living at my parent\\u2019s house that summer (2009), and spent many days visiting a friend who lived about 10min away on foot on a trail. He lived off of 228th St SE and about a block up the hill from 57th Ave, and I lived a little off of 224th St SE and 45th Ave. I could make my way to his house on this trail through a lot of heavily wooded land. If I started from the end of my driveway i\\u2019d take a left onto 45th Ave, and continue past 224th St down a driveway to a culdesac off of the main road. This went down a relatively steep hill, then turned left up a steep hill and leveled out at the tree line, which was where the entrance to the trail was. Winding my way up and downhill through the woods, I\\u2019d pop out most the way down 53rd Ave, N of its intersection with 228th St. I\\u2019d then take a right to walk down 53rd Ave, take a left onto 228th St and walk downhill until I was at my friend\\u2019s place. It was obviously used because the brush underfoot was consistently stamped flat, but in all my time living in that area the only people I ever saw on it were myself and any friends who might\\u2019ve taken the trip with me (maps.google.com, type in 50th Ave and 228th St SE) Having spent that night, like many before and after, relaxing on my friends patio with several other regulars, I got up, put out my cigarette, said my goodbyes and left. I walked out his driveway, took a left onto 228th, and walked towards 53rd. The night was moonless and so it was very dark; there were streetlights, but each of them was separated by 70-100ft or more and was only on one side of the road. It was probably around 1 in the morning, and it was normal for me to not see any cars on my short trip on the main road. Taking a right onto 53rd and then a left onto the trail most the way down it, I entered the trail. It was very, very still but the normal sounds were there for night time; some insects, the occasional rustle in the bushes of a smaller animal, nothing out of the ordinary. It was almost pitch black because of the tree cover, but I knew the trail like the back of my hand and walked confidently forward. Then it happened. Behind me to my right, probably about 20ft away, I heard movement in the brush and ferns. I didn\\u2019t even realizing I was hearing anything until it lasted more than a few seconds\\u2026and I realized it was moving in the same direction as me and breaking sizable tree branches underfoot. I stopped and listened. In a moment, the rustling came to a stop. I could hear faint, slow, deep breathing, like that of a large animal; it wasn\\u2019t loud enough to be from exertion, but seemed natural, as if whatever was behind the lung capacity was big enough to encompass several of my breaths in one of its own. I waited for about a minute and didn\\u2019t hear anything except the breathing, slow and even. I took another step and started down the trail again. And again, something moved through the woods after me, keeping pace and tempo with my movements. Sure enough I could hear ferns, ivy, blackberry bushes and the like being pulled or pushed aside, and that slow breathing started again. I stopped again, and this went on for another 5 or so minutes before I reached the trailhead, scared out of my wits. I still hadn\\u2019t heard any individual footsteps, hadn\\u2019t seen it or smelled anything; I don\\u2019t remember which way the wind was blowing, if there was one. I\\u2019d decided that once I hit the tree line, I\\u2019d make a run for it. So as I walked evenly up, followed in the same way I had been for several previous minutes, and trusting my years as a track runner (which I was fairly talented at), came to a stop and then bolted into a sprint down the hill. At moment later whatever was following me decided to move as well. As I pounded down the hill towards the right turn up 45th Ave, it too broke the trees from where I had, the gravel and then the asphalt. Its breathing became a series of low growls, almost a series of calls that sounded hoarse and aggressive. It was loud; loud enough to echo off the surrounding trees. But the moment it hit the gravel I knew something was wrong; of all the animals I\\u2019ve ever seen in their natural habitat that are native to western WA, none of them sounded like this one did. There was no lope, stride, or gallop that resembled how this thing sounded when it moved. One of the more intense memories of this incident was hearing that noise; distinctive impacts with the ground on not four, but two feet, and the smacking of bare feet on asphalt when it hit the driveway. That was quite unsettling, to say the least. But then another thing happened to my dismay and confusion; instead of following me down the driveway on the asphalt, it crossed back onto the asphalt and then into the woods to my right diagonally away from me. My first sensation was relief, until I realized it had increased its speed drastically, and its calls rang out from the woods in my direction still. Rounding the corner to go up 45th to get to the street level (and where there were streetlights), I realized it was trying to cut me off by getting ahead of me by cutting through the back yards of my neighbors across the street from me. Realizing this, I got a huge adrenaline rush as I absorbed the severity of having this thing, whatever it was, between my house and I. Running as fast as I could, I cleared the hill and started running on the flat towards my driveway off the road a little farther down. At the same time, behind me to my right, I heard this thing pound across a neighbor\\u2019s grass yard; heavy, distinct, single impacts of a two-legged animal. I\\u2019d been able to beat it to the road, but I wasn\\u2019t out of trouble yet. As I raced along the road it crossed their yard, leapt the 10ft ditch and landed 4 feet below on the asphalt road behind me all without stopping, tripping or stumbling once. It had kept on growling/calling at me, and guessing from the time it took for it to reach the road from their backyard I figure this thing couldn\\u2019t have been moving any slower than 20-25MPH; and I\\u2019ve been clocked at sprinting 22MPH before (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking. I skidded around the corner, short (not including adrenaline). As it pounded after me I heard once again the distinct sound of two individual feet contacting the ground. As I took a turn onto my driveway, my dog Gus, a purebred Airedale Terrier, started going off barking. I skidded around the corner, shortly followed by my pursuer, and got to my house with Gus running up to meet me. He was in full sprint; legs outstretched, heckles up, growling fiercely (and he was a gentle giant, he only acted that way towards squirrels/coyotes/raccoons). He must\\u2019ve seen what was after me and it stopped him dead in his tracks; he went from a sprint to 0 in about 3-5ft and started barking extravagantly. I stopped as I heard whatever this creature was stop and wheeled around to look back for the 1st time. Away from the streetlights on a moonless night with old pine/fir trees looming overhead, my eyes couldn\\u2019t see a damn thing. But I did see the gravel it must\\u2019ve kicked up by coming to such a fast halt land near my feet and felt it bonce off my shoes and lower legs as I was turning around. The three of us were all frozen in place for a single, quiet moment. Gus was growling, hair raised, ready to defend me. I was panting, standing straight and looking straight into the darkness. And whatever this creature was couldn\\u2019t have been more than 15ft in front of me, growling and breathing deeply enough to raise the hair on the back of my neck again even after being chased the way I was. Gus and I looked at each other at the same time and I said \\u201cstay\\u201d with all the gravity I could muster in my voice. He looked back into the darkness and continued growling as I dashed the garage, grabbed a hatchet and ran back. I returned to the same scene; Gus and this thing having a growl-off. I unsheathed the hatchet and stood ready, waiting, searching the blackness or any sign of this thing. But all I could hear was its breathing and the intense sensation that we were making eye contact; that this thing and I were holding each other with our eyes for several minutes. Then suddenly I heard crashing and rustling in the bushes moving away from me for a good 30 seconds, and Gus relaxed. We both went inside and I didn\\u2019t let him out at night for a week after that; after dark he\\u2019d sit by the windows and occasionally growl as if he\\u2019d seen something. He didn\\u2019t even do that to any of the other animals he\\u2019d normally go Terrier on. And each time he did I\\u2019d step outside and listen, and the woods would be filled with an unnatural quietness, or stillness. Since that night I can confidently say that I was stalked, followed, and then chased by a Bigfoot, that then was dissuaded by the presence of my dog and the light of the house so near.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Snohomish County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 30670: Night time foot race with an unseen animal near Woodinville\", \"latitude\": 47.7925, \"longitude\": -122.1676, \"date\": \"2009-07-06\", \"number\": 30670.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c23puh272x\", \"temperature_high\": 65.38, \"temperature_mid\": 59.94, \"temperature_low\": 54.5, \"dew_point\": 50.54, \"humidity\": 0.71, \"cloud_cover\": 0.74, \"moon_phase\": 0.48, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1015.74, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 6.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 187.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.72, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.1676 47.7925)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was out riding my bike and came to the logging road and started walking because you don't ride bikes where cougars dwell.

At approximately 2pm, my dog and I were walking towards the lake (it was about 1.5 miles away). We heard a very strange, humanoid yell come from across a marshy bog area. We both were taken by surprise and stopped. I looked across the bog area up towards the thick forest on the other side (about 75 yards away). I couldnt see any clothing of a hiker or potential body of a humanoid creature. The sound however was very interesting. I've spent many hours hiking the Washington state forests. I know what certain animals sound like when calling for a mate or calling to signal a warning. This noise was different. It was comparable to a person yelling directly and loudly \\\"yoouuuuuu!!!\\\". My dog and I stopped dead in our tracks and listened. About a minute went by and I heard the same noise again from the same area. The loud and direct \\\"yooouuuuu!!\\\". It was very strange. I'm positive that whatever made the noise was either a human toying with me, or some humanoid creature warning me of its presence. Being miles up alone in the wilderness, I didn't want to John Wayne across a bog into thick brush to investigate. It was the first time I've ever heard such a unique sound while out in the forest.

We got there early on Thursday to get the spot we wanted. It was for us the start of the Labor Day weekend. We had set up camp and drove up an old logging road to get our firewood for the night. There is a bridge close to our campsite. We had supper and relaxed around the campfire. At about 10:30 that night I decided to grab a flashlight and go looking around the area across the bridge. I really had not planned on looking for Bigfoot as I was busy with the logistics of putting this camping trip together. I am a true believer in Sasquatch, and read Bigfoot stories all the time(ask my wife). As I cleared the bridge there is a dead-end road on the right that goes down for about a quarter mile or so. I know this because I have been down there. The road is gated at the top with a pipe gate. In the middle of the gate is a red reflector. I could not see the reflector because something was standing in front of it. I had shined my just regular flashlight, with about \\u00be battery power down this road. What I did see was a pair of big yellow eyes, looking back at me. I FROZE. I remember thinking: Oh My GOD! I noticed that the right eye was much brighter than the left eye. I thought that perhaps there was some hair hanging down over the inside of the left eye. Or maybe it had an injury. I then noticed how far apart the eyes were. And how high up from the ground they were. Actually they were roughly even with mine, but the road there sloped down a bit. About four feet or more! I\\u2019m 5\\u20198\\u201d on a good day. This \\u201cthing\\u201d would have towered over me! The creature was either dark brown or black, as I could not make out any body or head features at all. Just those yellow eyes. There was no odor at all. The air was perfectly still. It made no noise either. I processed all this very quickly. If it would have growled at me it would have been laundry time! We stared at each other for maybe 10-12 seconds. It seemed to kind of lean side to side a little. Without moving its feet. Then the eyes dropped down a little and made a big circle. Pause. Then another circle same as the first. Like an owl, only way bigger. I thought that he had put his hands on his knees maybe. Kind of like I have seen on TV of apes moving.It looked at me for 3 more seconds and I lost it. Not knowing what this thing was going to do next, I took off running to the middle of the bridge and spun around. Every hair on my body was standing up. It did not follow me. I was not surprised. But I was also very happy. I was panting. Mostly from adrenaline, I think! I hustled back to camp and told Dave what happened. I said \\u201cLet\\u2019s go back over there. \\u201cGrab your camera\\u201d (a digital with a strong flash and video+audio). I was very excited. I knew that this could be a chance of a lifetime to get this thing on film. You have to understand that in my mind, there was nothing else that this creature could be than a REAL Sasquatch. I completely believe it to this day. Anyways, Dave Cannot find his camera. After we looked for a couple of minutes or so I get pissed and said, or words to the effect \\u201cLet\\u2019s go while this thing is still in the same county\\u201d! So we get to the bridge and walk fast at first, then slow way down being quiet. I whispered \\u201c You watch the left side and I\\u2019ll watch this side. We\\u2019ll try to get both flashlights on it at the same time\\u201d. Dave\\u2019s flashlight was about the same as mine). It wasn\\u2019t in front of the gate anymore. That didn\\u2019t surprise me. What I did see was the red reflector. I did not even know it was even there the 1st time. But there it was. It would have stuck out like a sore thumb! It was blocked by the Bigfoot.On Dave\\u2019s side was a pull-out. It was empty. (The next night some people \\u2018Camped\\u2019 there). I told Dave \\u201cShine your light up the road\\u201d. There HE was! On my side walking slowly towards us. He had the exact same eyes. The left one was messed up, just like the 1st time! Dave and I were about 10-12 feet apart. I said \\u201cDave, THERE HE IS! Do you see him? He\\u2019s coming Dave! There he is!\\u201d. Both of our lights had shined on this things face at the same time. Only for like 3 seconds or so. But it lit his head up!  The head did not look pointed to me, like many people have reported. It was really BIG though. I was slowly backing up as I watched it walking towards us. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you see it ?\\u201d \\u201cNo\\u201d he says. I was backing up slowly out of fear as I\\u2019m watching the eyes move up and down rhythmically. . Well, it turns out that Dave can\\u2019t see much in bright sunlight.  At night he is basically following the sound of your voice. So he can\\u2019t find his camera at the critical time; and I have no witness to this incidence, even though he was right there with me! I love the guy. But FU$%! So I get scared and take off running to the middle of the bridge again, with Dave behind me. The only reason he is running is because I was. You ever hear the joke about never going Grizzly Bear hunting with a friend who can out-run you? Well I out-weight Dave and he had trouble keeping up!   It was HUGE!  Also, although the road was going up hill, it was very straight and flat. I was familiar with this stretch of road, having camped there many times. And this gave me a great idea of how tall this thing was. When I say it was pushing ten feet tall, I feel confident that this is an accurate judgment of its true height. And there were NO tree branches there at all to justify an owl sitting on a limb. If it was an owl, it would have to be 10 feet tall. So we quickly get back to camp. Dave of course, finds his camera. Under his sleeping bag. We jumped into the van and shot across the bridge. Of course we could not find him. I knew he was just inside the trees on one side or the other. It was as dark as the inside of a Buffalo on a moon-less night. The next morning I walked across the bridge to the top of the road on the right. I walked up to the pipe gate and stood there. Right exactly where HE stood. I paced it off, and it was roughly 45 yards to where I stood when I first spotted him. Boy, I sure will bring a massive candle power flashlight next time! And have a camera ready as well. But you get your chances when they happen. I was not prepared! One thing I haven\\u2019t mentioned. At the time this all happened, I had truly forgotten that in my tent were my two guns. I had my 9mm, plus a 12 gauge sawed-off double barreled shotgun(side by side and barely legal) loaded with 00 BUCK. It had never occurred to me to shoot this guy. I had completely forgotten that I was heavily armed! When he was walking down the road towards us, he, in retrospect, was just kind of shooing us away I think. I think of him as being a gentle giant! He very easily could have run us down and killed us. I feel blessed that they are out there. He did not harass us or threaten us in any way. Other than just leisurely walking towards us and scaring the CRAP out of me!I will go back there this summer,more prepared for sure. STOP!!!!!! - I haven\\u2019t told anyone yet, except for now. I also have a Class B report that happened back in 1975, up it Whatcom County near the Canadian border. This encounter was truly TERRIFIYING! Scared all 3 of us, plus the Big German Shepard ( who PEED himself) that  we had with us in a remote cabin. Ask me about that Story!!

We had been talking about going up since the snow melted and we could get back up to the site. Anyway Friday July 5th we finally got the chance to go up. There was \\\"J.H,\\\" \\\"J. McK\\\", \\\"C.C. Jr\\\", \\\"G.C.\\\", \\\"J. Mc\\\", and myself, \\\"R.S\\\". \\\"J\\\" brought his Night Vision Goggles. None of them had a vehicle that could actually get to the site as I had before so we parked off the main  road and decided to hike up the road and see how far we could get. So we eventually got to about a quarter up the road and my legs started hurting, I am a bit over weight so I had to stop and rest because the group was so excited and intrigued by what we may find/ see that they wanted to get to where I saw my huge sighting last summer. So after being stopped for about 5 minutes I suggested to \\\"J\\\", who had brought a wooden broom handle, to do 6 tree knocks because there were 6 of us there. So we waited silently for about 2-3 minutes and we got a low sound of one knock from what sounded like 20 or so feet off the right hand side of the road, if we would not have been quiet we would have missed it. Then we all turned to focus on that side of the road and saw 2 sets of eye shine, one a silver bluish color and the other orange. The orange one's eyes where almost on top of each other as if it was leaning up against the tree or something or turned its head in a question like manner. Then the group decided I should try to call out to them so I decided to try some whoops. I turned my back toward them just in case they could actually see me so I could make it sound as if it came from the opposite side of the road and let out a series of about 6-8 whoops each last about 5-10 seconds in length of variant volumes then ended with a loud one that lasted about 8 seconds. After about 15 seconds or so we heard a low grumble type sound, not quite a growl but very guttural. Then a short (about 4-6 second) low whoop. By now it was about 30 minutes of us staying at this site and \\\"J\\\" and I started to get very scared of something on the road ahead of us not sure how far up the road. Eventually we started to see a very bright pair of the silver bluish eye shine up in the trees moving around, we though it was a young one. All this time the 2 off to the right side of the road were still there. There is a shallow slope on that side of the road that was some where between 3-4 feet to the height of the road then they came to about our eye height so I am guessing that they were somewhere between 7 and 8 feet tall. After 45 minutes we decided to turn back to the quarry/ gravel pit. When we were almost there we heard a low moaning sound that they do, come from the left side of the road which in this area is a hill and goes up from the road about 15- 20 feet. So we stopped and they asked me to try to imitate that sound. I tried my best but it sounded to much like a moo. Anyway I then asked \\\"J\\\" to do another round of tree knocks. No response this time so we carried on back to the quarry area. I then heard some rustling in the grass from within this open area, I asked for the NVGs and as I searched the area I saw one walking in the grass. Once it noticed that we had seen it it hunkered down and moved back into the grass. I passed the NVGs to \\\"J\\\" who had been the most skeptical about the whole thing and wanted to see what I was seeing. Eventually it got passed around so everyone could see it. \\\"J\\\" wanted to push forward and surround it and possibly catch it. I opposed that idea but said lets move in slowly so we could hopefully get a better view of it in the NVGs so we got some where around 10-7 feet from it before we had a rock thrown off to the side of us, I asked for the goggles and when I saw it, it was giving the motion that it wanted us to back off. So we slowly made our way back to the car. The one we saw in the quarry area was about 6-7 feet.\", \"location_details\": \"Mountain Loop Highway, east of Granite Falls, WA.\", \"county\": \"Snohomish County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 41602.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"Me, my wife, and our 7 year old son were out for an evening bear hunt up to Coal Lake last night.

After looking around a bit we got back in the truck and headed down the hill. We drove about 1/4 mile and found a small pile of scat in the road so I stopped to look at it, that's when I got a feeling that I was being watched. I went back to the truck and grabbed  my rifle and continued to look around. As I cleared the rear of the truck and approached the edge of the bank I started hearing some thrashing below me. I got excited thinking we found a bear but the longer we sat the less excited and more uneasy I got. The thrashing didn't move unless I moved. I worked my way down the road past the front of the truck trying to see what was making the noise but couldn't see it. I did get really nervous at this point because the thrashing followed me down the road. I have hunted elk and bear in Montana and Washington my whole life and never had one parallel the road with me nor be that close without growling. I was very well armed with a sidearm and a heavy magnum rifle but I had no interest in exploring this more.

I wanted to find a place to shoot that was off the road and away from any trails, the river, or possible campers. Found a spot that didn\\u2019t have a car for more than a mile each way. Pulled over and loaded up about 10 magazines. Spent about 15 minutes getting everything ready on the tailgate of my truck. Heard absolutely nothing but birds chirping. I hiked down a ravine to the left of the road about 150 yards and shot off some rounds for about 15 minutes. Finished up and walked back up to the car where my girlfriend had been waiting. As soon as I came out of the ravine and onto the road we both heard a LOUD cracking / snap noise from the top of the wooded hill that was to the right of the road, the opposite side of where I had been shooting. We both looked at each other wondering what it was, our jaws dropped. It wasn\\u2019t a tree breaking because we didn\\u2019t hear anything hit the ground. There was also no wind less a sporadic slight breeze. We heard the noise approximately 6-7 times and there was about 30 seconds between each one. It was very loud and very, very close. The time between each one was also very consistent. My girlfriend and I both said that we could hear it coming form the top of the hill maybe 100 yards from the truck. We could also hear something moving around. Not twigs and branches snapping but it sounded like bark rounds being stepped on and ripping. A strange noise, it actually sounded like something ripping bark from a tree too. I grabbed my cell phone and walked up the hill to where the sound was coming from. Filmed about ten minutes. I was filming up and to the right of the hill for a good 6 minutes. As soon as I walked a little closer to the top of the hill and started filming to my left another cracking sound rings out, startled the hell out of me because it was so close. The camera actually shakes when the noise starts from me reacting. This was just about seven minutes into filming. I heard the sound of bark or something again, like it was peeling off a tree. I couldn\\u2019t help but think that the sound was coming from up in a tree. I got it on my phone and you can hear how loud it was, and how close. I would guess whatever was making the noise was about 50 yards away. Returned to the car and left. I thought it was very strange that this noise didn\\u2019t start until after I made all the noise shooting. When I made it to the area where the noise originated I could see my truck. It\\u2019s like whatever made the noise waited until it saw me get back on the road. The noise it made was so loud I am perplexed as to what it was. It sounded like a large branch being hit on a tree and snapping. I can\\u2019t think of any animal that makes any noise that loud. I\\u2019ve spent countless hours in the backcountry and camping and have never heard anything like it. As much as I wanted to climb the next 50 yards to the very top of the hill I couldn\\u2019t bring myself to do it. I had the feeling that whatever the hell was making that noise was protesting my being there.

An hour or two after we went to bed I was still awake because the rest of the group hadn't made it to the lake and I was worried about them. A wind break of poles about 6' tall was beside us and a head was moving along on the far side of it. I thought it was one of our group. When it got to the far end of the wind break it squated down and began going through my pack. This didn't bother me because I thought that one of our group needed something. I said \\\"You finally made it.\\\" It stood up and at this point and I realized it was a foot or two higher than the wind break. Between the moon and what was left of the fire I could see what some years later people were calling Bigfoot. It turned and walked away into the night. Update: December 12, 1999. Before I start let me say that although my memory is still quite clear there are certain parts that I am not sure of. I am going to try to get in touch with Glen and get his memory of the night and make sure I'm not forgeting or wrong about any of it. Glen was the president and I was the VP of the Edmonds Junior Sportsmen's club. Our group of about 6 kids and one adult left on a Friday to go to Lake Colchuck. The adult fell into the creek at a crossing about two miles in. We had about four miles to go. Glen and I decided to go on ahead and build a fire so the adult could dry off when he got there. It got dark long before we got to the lake. So dark that we couldn't see the lake when we first got there. We lost the trail or actually the trail ended because we were at the lake. We started circling around looking for the trail. One of us would stay put while the other walked around looking. We stayed in touch by yelling back and forth. Glen found a lean to and we set up camp for the night. The moon started showing through the clouds and Glen went looking around. He came back and said we were just past the lake. I took a pan to go get some water from the lake to cook with. When I was dipping water from the lake I heard screams from the other side of the lake. Suddenly the screams were about half way around the lake. I thought a cougar was racing around the lake to attack me. I ran back to camp and grabbed my .22 rifle and waited with Glen for the cougar to show up. It didn't so we decided to scramble eggs since I dropped the water while running back to the lean to. We decided finally that the rest of the group wasn't coming up that night so we went to bed. A hour of two later I was still awake and saw the head moving along the other side of the wind break. At the far end of the windbreak, about 10 or 15 feet from my feet it squatted down and started going through my pack. I thought it was the adult possibly getting some dry clothes. I said \\\"You finally made it.\\\" The thing stood up and I finally realized it was quite a bit taller that the wind break. I realized it wasn't who I thought it was. It was about 7 1/2 or 8 feet tall and wider than most men. I was scared and confussed. Even though the .22 was right beside me I was too scared to move. After several seconds what ever it was turned and started walking away. I woke Glen up and told him to look. He couldn't see anything at this point but we could both hear it moving through the trees. In the morning after a sleepless night I went to my pack and noticed that it wasn't torn but my stuff was all over the ground. The part of the story that seems to make people not believe me is that the only thing gone was the oreo cookies. The package was there but no cookies. I didn't see the thing eat them but I don't know how else they could have disappeared. When the rest of the group showed up I told them the story and the adult said it had to be a bear. Only it wasn't. Someone made some comment about a big foot but neither I or anyone else believed in that. Later that day we were walking around the lake to where the screams came from the night before. The talis slope was formed by some very large rocks. One large slablike stone formed a sort of cave under it. Inside at the far end was some brush and maybe grass. There was hair on the brush that looked to be black. Everyone decided it was a bear den and that was what I had seen the night before. Some years later while working with my dad in someone's house I noticed a magazine with a kind of siloutte of a sasquatch on the cover. I think it was called \\\"The year of the Sasquatch\\\" or something like that. I looked inside on the sightings page and in the Colchuck Lake area there were a bunch of dots. That's when I allowed myself to believe that maybe these things do exist. I also listened to some of the recordings others have made. The high pitched screams very closely resembled the \\\"cougar\\\" screams I heard while getting water.\", \"location_details\": \"From Levenworth Washington, up the Icicle River road to a trail-head leading to several lakes on the way to the Enchantment's area.

The witness did not write up the story himself.] On November 9th, 2006,  the local media in southeastern Wisconsin ran a story about a possible sighting near Holy Hill. The story refered to the contracted worker whose job it is to pick up deer carcasses on the highway on a regular basis.  Some  versions of the news story said a deer carcass was stolen from his truck by an alleged bigfoot. The story ran in many newspapers across the country and quickly got the attention of various bigfoot researchers. Local TV also started reporting on the story. Local TV also reported on the story and used it as a good humor story for their broadcasts. Due to the topic awareness created by the local news story, other people in the area began talking about observations and experiences they had with a similar looking figure. I first sought out the contracted worker. He was frustrated because the media seemed to put words in his mouth about the incident. He didn't know what the animal was, and he did not say that it was a bigfoot. He merely described what happened, and what he observed. He emphatically stated he did not call it a bigfoot. The state trooper's report conveys what happened, and what Steve observed. It does not call it a bigfoot either, but some elements of the story seemed consistent with sasquatch behavior, especially the  Because of the deer element, the BFRO wanted to get a detailed, first-hand account of what Steve K. observed and experienced. I met with him a week later (11/17). We spoke for 45 minutes. He came across as a patient, rational person. I started off by measuring the distance from the front seat of the extended cab Dodge pickup to the end of the pickup with the tail-gate down, it was 13.5 feet. He showed me the lights he had on at the time: head lights, interior dome light, factory bed light, and he had an 18\\u2019\\u2019 amber beckon light flashing on top of the cab. The beckon light is positioned on the cab like a police car\\u2019s official lights where, there\\u2019s one flashing light on each end. I got into the diver\\u2019s seat of the pickup, looked in the center mirror like Steve K.  had done, AND had him stand were he saw the creature. He stood in the middle of the pickup just behind the open tail gate. I could see all of his head, and on the bottom, halfway between his shoulders and his elbows. Steve K. stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 230 lb. The lighting was sparse, but I could see his facial features. If it was an all black form like what Steve says, I can\\u2019t imagine being able to see a lot of detail. Next we spoke about the sequence of events. Steve K. was driving west-bound along Holy Hill Rd., on 11/9/06 at 1:30am, and 15 yards west of the intersection of Troll Hill Road he found a dead deer. The deer wasn\\u2019t on his list of dead deer to pick up. He had just happened upon it and he figured he\\u2019d pick it up because he knew he would have to pick it up later. Steve K.  receives a list of dead deer locations faxed to him each morning. He lifted up the 80 \\u2013 100 lb dead doe himself, put it in the back of the pickup with the four other dead deer. He didn\\u2019t notice anything unusual about the dead deer and there weren\\u2019t any strange sounds around him. He got into the pickup, closed the door, reached for his clip board.  He didn\\u2019t have a chance to open the clipboard because that\\u2019s when he first felt the pickup shudder. He thought it was the wind. Almost instantaneously, it shuddered again. He instinctively looked up at the center mirror and saw a dark figure reaching into the bed of the pickup. He said it was all black, had a head that was a cross between a black bear and a wolf. Its ears were pointed straight up, not folded over. He knew it wasn\\u2019t a bear. He could see something like a muzzle, but he couldn\\u2019t see its eyes. He said it reached out with one \\u201carm\\u201d. He could not see \\\"whether it had claws or fingers or hands\\u201d. It had three-foot wide shoulders and described it as being \\u201cstocky\\u201d. He said it was about has tall as I am (5\\u201910\\u2019\\u2019) when it was reaching into the bed. I stood behind the pickup so he could gauge the height of what he had seen. He watched it at the most five seconds where the first couple of seconds he was trying to figure out what it was. The next few seconds fear was setting in. \\u201cIt scared the crap out of me\\u201d. Steve K. quickly pulled away and didn\\u2019t bother to look in the mirror as he left. He heard the ramp hit the ground as he headed west. When he set the deer in the pickup \\u2018it must have gotten tangled with the ramp\\u2019. The deer that was taken was the one that he had just put in. He went back five (5) minutes later and there was no deer, and no ramp. The reason he went back was, because he needed the ramp along with the remaining ramp in the pickup to wench in heavy deer in to the bed of the pickup. Background Info: Steve goes out every other night to pick up road kill. He drives 450 miles a night and picks up from 9 to 18 deer. He\\u2019s been doing this for 18 months and nothing like this has ever happened to him before. On occasion he\\u2019ll pick up a deer and hear scavengers in the bushes. Steve said, occasionally there won\\u2019t be a carcass to pick up at an assign spot, and he attributes that to a program called \\u201cEarn-A-Buck\\u201d. Washington county participates in a program where a person can bring in a dead doe and get a buck tag for it. He says the DNR knows that people are probably bringing in road kill to get the buck tag. He also laughingly suggested that people could be taking the road kill to eat. The deer that he picked up on that night wasn\\u2019t more than 2 hours old, as rigamortis had not set in. He could not tell if it was still warm because he was using gloves. On occasion he\\u2019d pick up deer that have been scavenged on, and the entrails will be gone. He can tell if a deer\\u2019s peritoneum cavity (gut) has been opened by something chewing on it, or if it\\u2019s been ripped open. He couldn\\u2019t say what would open a deer by ripping it open. He said that he could tell if something had been cut opened because he\\u2019s a deer hunter and knows what it looks like, and he has never seen that on road kill. Bear rarely venture that far south in the state. On the morning that I interviewed him, he said earlier in the night, he was at the intersection of Hwy 83 and Q, and he was picking up a deer.

So as we were heading back to our car after hiking for two hours, I decided to pick up a stick and try making some wood knocks. To our surprise, there was a response. Mind you, we had been hearing gunshots in the area, local wildlife, and the sounds of trees scraping against each other. And what we heard was a knocking noise we couldn't explain. I knocked once, and we heard a knock in reply. Then I knocked in a series of three, and we got a three knocked response. Then, the knocks started going rapid one after another. I then replied in the same fashion, knocking rapidly one after another. Then it stopped. I made several attempts later to try tree knocking again in hopes of getting a response again, but no luck. I had the idea that if it was a sasquatch, it figured out it wasn't communicating with another Sasquatch so it stopped replying. My dad and I both heard it and decided that it could have only been either another human being messing with us or it was in fact a sasquatch. This makes me want to look into the area more. Because we never heard that noise until I started tree knocking the first time. And then never heard the noise again. We ruled out the idea that is was just a wood pecker, because wood peckers make noise whenever they want and not really in reply to something.

Imagine that he has a microphone, amplifier, and good speakers: that is what it sounded like.

They ran from west to east towards the direction we had been coming from. Above the easternmost track there was a 5th print that was the best to view. These two prints had been created by a biped who put most of their weight on the lower down hill leg while placing only a small amount of weight on the uphill leg. As a result, the lower foot had slipped about 8 inches down the slope, tearing the slope to the wet clay beneath. The upper track was 16 inches long and over 4 inches wide. The track that had exposed the wet ground was less than 10 minutes old when we found it, since it dried before our eyes to form a dry crust. My husband, Mark tried to duplicate the track's depth and appearance by stomping his hiking boot into the ground. It required 5 such kicks. The main line of tracks were spaced at over 4 feet apart. When Mark tried to duplicate this same stride length, he fell because the slope was 45 degrees. Above the 5th track, there appeared to be toe-kick-in prints made as the subject turned to go directly up the slope. The tracks vanished in an area covered with deep pine needles. We followed the general direction of the prints uphill until we came to a large nest. The nest was next to a pine on the uphill side. It was about 3 to 3.5 feet high, made of pine needles and was shaped sort of like a volcano with a hole at the top. The hole was about 2 to 3 feet wide. We took pictures of the best track, and the nest. Over a decade later, we were watching a special about China on P.B.S. that showed what was supposed to be a nest of the Chinese version of Bigfoot. It looked just as ours had except the one in China was made of twigs. It appears that the subject was moving our direction, then stopped to view us.

My family & I had been going to Holden Village every summer for several years.

On the last night the kids were having a round of \\\"hide & go seek \\\" in the dark around the main camp. All the adults were gathered at the main picnic table area & all us kids were running around having a good ole' time in the dark. I was determined to not have any of the kids find me, so I decided to run off a bit further...over behind the maintenance shed, by the stinky garbage cans & over by a very steep drop off. My eyes were already adjusted to the dark, even though there were several outside lights in the main area. As I ran around the back of the maintenance shed, I stopped & heard a slight movement in the gravel on the hard ground....I stopped, looked over (10 feet away) & saw a HUGE black mass/shadow hunkered over the garbage cans, which were chained down. The huge mass stopped whatever it was doing, turned, & in one SMOOTH MOTION, turned at the waist ,& stood up right to about 8 plus feet tall. No smell, no noise,(except for the sound of crunching gravel on hard pan soil).  My first thought was, \\\"OMG! It's a bear!\\\"...but because of the motion & shape I thought...\\\"This is a MAN IN A COAT with his hood up\\\"....I was so shocked & confused that I backed up after about 3 seconds & then turned & ran to get my parents. Whatever it was could have reached out & grabbed me easily but did not. The only way it could have gone was after me (into a well lighted area), around the back of the building (another WELL lighted area), OR straight down a VERY steep shale cliff side down towards a river. When I found my folks & told them \\\"I saw a bear-man,\\\" they freaked out & got a camp ranger & reported that either a weirdo or a bear was behind one of the buildings ....I was told it was a BEAR, so ,of course, I believed it was the biggest bear in the whole world for years! There is more to the story, but I just wanted to let you guys know that maybe you might want to check out the Lake Chelan area! I have checked  to see if there have been any more reports...there have been a few. I know what I saw & my son has encouraged me to report this after all these years.

This next detail may or may not be relevant since it is quite inconclusive, but I'll mention it nevertheless.

I have heard deer, elk, bear, cougar and all of the different noises they make. What I experienced recently while hunting was something I have Never in all my life seen or heard before. It shook me up very bad. I was always very skeptical of bigfoot but after this experience, I am convinced. On Oct. 17th 2002, I was hunting deer on Silver creek, approximately 32 miles up the Entiat River valley, at about 4500-4700 ft elevation. My plan was to hunt up the creek on steep, heavy timbered ground up toward a knob called Big Hill. I planned to hunt slowly. Go as far as I could until noon and head back down to my truck which was parked on an old non maintained forest service road about 5 miles from the Shady Pass Road ( which is a steep dirt rd. It also goes up to big hill and then over to lake chelan....a  34 mile trip). I left the truck and was in the timber before daylight (about 6:50 am). I was hunting uphill, going slow, and angling away from the creek. I was finding lots of deer sign and it looked like a promising day. I went about 100 yards before seeing a small buck bedded and jumping some does up. I walked on for 45 or more minutes. The deer sign quit except for a couple old tracks. I was standing quietly to plan my direction when I heard what sounded like logs or poles being thrown onto a pile of more poles. I heard this sound three different times in a row,  just a few minutes apart. There were no hunters or other people in this remote area. Walking further up the hill I saw a draw coming up. Looking around for my best entrance, I see a White Fir tree approx. 24 \\\" on base with an oval piece of bark missing. I figured it must have been done by bear or buck deer. I walked down to it to discover only one gouge on the bark above scar. It obviously wasn't done by a bear or deer. It appeared to be pulled off gently and exact. The top was eye level to me, and the bottom was about 10\\\"-12\\\" above ground. there was only one small piece of bark on the ground about 4\\\" wide and 12\\\" long also shaped in a perfect oval. The sap on tree was untouched. I turned and walked to the edge of the draw. Looking down only 12 feet or so at the bottom, was what appeared to be a large deer bed. When I got down to it, it was an area the size of three dinner tables. It was covered in fir and pine needles and obviously well packed. Standing there I could hear water running. Looking down into a hole on the downhill edge of this, was a short under ground creek exposed. The hole was approx. 4 feet long, 12 in wide, and 20-24 inches deep, with a flow of water at the bottom. I glanced up the draw. It was steep and covered with nothing but fir needles and old rotten logs. The same below but not as steep. The next thing I noticed really got my attention. Water had recently been splashed up and over one side of the hole onto the dry fir needles. Feeling uneasy, I walked up and out of the other side of the draw on a well worn, well packed path covered in fir and pine needles. The area has a lot of little bushes which resemble a miniature huckleberry, the plant no taller than 6\\\" high. These on the edges of the path were also smashed down flat. There was no sign of bear tracks in area. At the upper crest of the path  I studied a track, human like but with no signs of toes. It was about the length of my boot (I wear a size 12). Where the ball of the human foot is straight across, this seemed to bump up in the middle but no sign of toes. (Meaning that the whole size of this foot had to have been much larger than that of any humans). The ground was hard and had some needles on it. Looking up ahead I saw Willow bushes in an opening in the timber. I was trying to decide whether to go up or below it when I noticed what seemed to be stacked dead logs inside of what appeared to be a circle of Willow bushes approx. 60 feet in diameter. Planning to walk closer to get a better look, I almost step on feces that I have never seen before. (I have been an avid hunter and hiker for many years and have NEVER seen the looks of this before). It was a weird textue and color and looked more human than bear or cougar. I decided to take a picture with my disposable camera I had in my backpack. As I was taking my pack off, I glanced downhill and caught a glimpse of what looked to be some brown fur quickly ducking down behind a buckskin log. I didnt get a good look so I thought it could have just been a squirrel since the area was full of them, but it was too large, and also, the last thing you see of a squirrel is its tail and not a patch of fur. I began to get very uncomfortable. I pulled out my camera from my pack and knelt down and took a picture of the feces. Wanting to be sure it worked, I decided I should take another one. I then got the idea that after I took the second picture, I would empty a ziploc bag I had in my pack containing my trail snacks and take a feces sample back with me to turn into someone for some further investigation on it. I knelt even closer to get my second picture, started to wind the camera and all of a sudden from behind me I hear a sound I cant even really describe. You had to be there to hear it yourself to get any sense of just how this thing sounded. It was a \\\"whuuuuuuuuu\\\"  sound. A kind of a roar like, yell like sound. It was very low and lungy and louder in decibals than any human, even one shouting as loud as he could right in my ear. It had to have come from something with a very large set of lungs. It was a very threatening, warning type of sound accompanied by a large crash like that of a log being thrown through large bushes. Looking up and behind me, all I saw was two squirrels running panickedly down the hill through the draw and up a fir tree not more than 10 feet in front of me. I decided I was OUT OF THERE, shoving my camera in my pack. I looked up to the squirrels sitting on the lower branches. They were looking in the direction the noise came from and making a lot of racket. I think I may have even said outloud \\\"OK I'M LEAVING\\\" as I got my pack onto my back. Not thrilled about having to go back in the direction of the noise, I unsnapped my 44 mag. handgun in my holster. I was trying to leave lower toward the creek than I had come. As I passed by the draw I looked below to see the tree with the bark missing, so I headed even more down hill. I could faintly hear Silver creek below me maybe a 1/4 mile or so away. Inititally trying to be quiet, I felt it best to make all the noise I could. So I stepped on every dead limb and branch I could. Going around a tree, I almost stepped on some more feces. It was the same color, gray and tan with some white specs throughout, but this was much larger and more of a constipated texture. It had kind of a pink or champagne tint to it. I thought about stopping to retrieve a sample but I wasnt about to stop and kneel down again. For the first 200 yards or so, I could hear something purposefully making loud noise (Stuff crashing around and what sounded to be large things being tossed and thrown) it stayed just out of my sight below and behind me. Then as I neared the road, it all appeared to just stop and I felt I was left alone. As I finished my desent out ,and for the rest of the day, all I could think about was that sound. How loud and breathy it sounded. A person standing right behind me couldnt be even half that loud. It sounded like the exact same sound my son and daughter's boyfriend had described to me last November  while hunting In the late buck season.

Strangely enough,I have reported a sighting my family had in 1994 in Wyoming.This was reported in your February 2001 listing under new sightings. My brother In Law Dan, told me of his experience after I told him that I reported mine to BFRO! Dan's story goes like this: He had gone up to visit some people camping in a trailer. As he arrived and turned off his motorcycle engine, he observed something dark in color moving on an open hillside below a timber line. There was snow on the ground, it was getting towards dusk and it was a little foggy.The thing was two hundred and fifty yards away approximately. As Dan observed this thing, he noticed it was quite tall, seven feet or more in height. This thing let Dan know that he saw Dan by looking back directly at Dan, as he continued walking uphill towards the timber. He looked back at Dan several times without breaking his stride. His stride was long, longer than a man's, and was effortless as he walked through the snow. Dan thought, what kind of a man would be wearing a dark hairy suite that covered his entire body, out in the forest? Dan also noticed that this thing was much bigger than any man he has seen and it's build was very big! Dan felt it could weigh a good six hundred pounds or so. This creature disappeared into the timber. Dan knew he had seen something very unusual and he was aware of Big Foot sightings in the news.

The fog was coming in and I had not seen any Turkeys so I turned around and headed for the truck. The Fog was getting thick and I could only see about 35 yards.About halfway to the truck the wind changed and was blowing down the hill.

I quickly turned facing the smell with my shotgun slung but I did not see or hear anything.Again I could only see about 35 yards because of the Fog.At this moment I felt it was the smell of a Sasquatch.

The Length and the Volume and the Depth of the Howl could not be duplicated by a human being.I asked my Nephew if his gun was loaded and if he wanted to try to get a look at it? He said yes.We moved a little closer toward the scream but did not see anything. It was in scatered Pine Trees.We headed back up the ridge and West aways and stopped.

We were staying with a friend and his family. After the few days were up, my friend and I decided to stay another day and sleep in the car that night. That night we drove to the top of a hill through some pretty thick woods on some really unkept dirt road until we reached a small clearing. We hung out for a while sitting on the hood of the car smoking cigarettes and watching shooting stars, looking for UFO's, and listening to animal noises. We'd often hear something then speculate what it was. Then all of the sudden we heard a very loud raspy scream/roar. I immediatley expected it was a cougar but about 1 second after the screech we heard 3 deep thuds in the earth as if someone was slamming a huge tree trunk against the ground. the thuds had an even rythem like someone knocking on a door. These thuds were immediatley followed by another scream and 3 more thuds, then a 3rd scream and 3 more thuds again. after the 2nd scream we immediatly started scrambling to get into the car. We sat in the car silently, listening for quite a while. Then began speculating what it could have been. I am extremely skeptical by nature and did not allow myself to seriously consider the possibility that the animals was a sasquatch or bigfoot or some other unexplained creature even though i could not explain to myself what could have caused the scream in conjunction with the loud thumps. Trying to seem level-headed and unafraid, I just decided to go to sleep. An hour or 2 later I was awakened by my friend who seemed to be panicking a little bit. He told me he heard another sound and that we had to go. As we were driving he explained that he had to piss really bad for a while but didnt want to go outside the car. Evetually, he just decided to get out but was startled by a rustling in the bushes nearby (this time to the right of the car) and another scream (i'm not totally sure he actually heard another scream). we then drove all the way back down at 3 or so in the morning and slept parked on the side of the road. I'm aware that animals can make some pretty weird noises at night but this was just insane. the thuds were the most confusing part though. Unless maybe a 10 foot tall grizzly bear was slamming a tree against the ground? It sounded fairly diliberate, as if warning us. It couldve been a human just messing with us but we were far from houses or any good reason to be in the woods. I also really doubt a human couldve made the screaching noise because it was extremely loud and primal sounding. I never thought about reporting it because it just doesnt seem possible and i figured there HAD to be a logical explanation.  -Chase S.\", \"location_details\": \"it was up a dirt road that wound up hillsides into woods. very close to downtown chelan.\", \"county\": \"Chelan County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 21659.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"I work for BNSF railroad.

She calls to Nick: \\\"Nick, there are some kids out there trying to tease the horse\\\" and steps out the kitchen back door with a BB-gun in her hands for good measure. Nick races out past her and some distance down the overgrown meadow along the stand of trees, where he comes abruptly face to face with a sasquatch standing on the indistinct foot path. Nick comes to such a \\\"screeching halt\\\" that he slides on moist vegetation and sits down on the ground. For reassurance he throws a backward look to his mother who, however, has returned to the house. When he looks back at the sasquatch, it is already walking with long strides across the brush and wildflower covered meadow, \\\"lifting up his feet more than people do\\\". As Nick scrambles to get up, a branch snaps and the sasquatch turns to look at him \\\"with big eyes\\\". Nick runs back into the house, tearing the screen door off its hinges in the process, to tell his mother about the creature and to change into boots from his slippery loafers. Then he charges back out, taking a large army bayonet from over the fireplace for protection, with Brenda close behind. Their two dogs have retreated under the house. As he runs down through the same meadow, the sasquatch is still walking about there, retreats downhill, crosses a small creek and stops on the far bank of the creek under a fir tree to face his pursuers, his entire body bathed in sunlight and visible from head to toe. Nick stops about 30' away, his mother stands about 15' behind him. This silent tableau holds its place for what seems an extraordinarily long time, perhaps 5 minutes, although Nick's and Brenda's estimates, colored by the adrenaline of the encounter, range as high as 20 minutes. Whatever length of time passes, it gives Nick and Brenda the opportunity for detailed inspection of the sasquatch. They describe it as being 6'6\\\" tall (as measured against a branchlet that barely touched the crown of its head), covered with black-gray fur and golden brown patches on its shoulders and chest. The hair is 4\\\"-5\\\" long and dirty with burrs in it. The head is notable for its pronounced brow ridge and deep set eyes, that are \\\"less open than human eyes\\\" [facing into the sun]. It has a wide and stumpy nose, the hairiness under the nose getting thicker, hiding the jaw line. It has impressively wide shoulders (\\\"Man, they were this wide!\\\", Nick holds his hands far apart in retelling), heavy arms, wide hands with thick fingers and dark brown and rough palms. Its nails have a deep yellow \\\"nicotine-stained\\\" color. Its torso narrows somewhat to the waist, no genitals are visible in the fur, and it has \\\"sort of a small butt for a man\\\", according to Brenda's astute assessment. Both observers perceive the animal as a male. Neither of them detects any smell. In due time Brenda gets the \\\"willies\\\" and anxiously screams to Nick to break it off. Thereupon the sasquatch screams, takes a step across the creek toward them, while holding its arms out to the side by about 45 degrees, as if to herd them on their way. They run halfway up the hill to the house, when Nick feels compelled to give it one more look. He is rewarded by a repeat of the faintly aggressive display. They continue to the house, Brenda scooping up John from the lawn, who says: \\\"Mommy, there is a big monkey in our backyard\\\". Brenda climbs up on the low garage roof and watches the sasquatch walk away. The dogs stay under the house for a safe two hours and will not let themselves be coaxed out, even by having meat waved at them. The horse has substantial abrasions on its fetlocks from having gotten snagged on a rope in its panic. Brenda phones 911, but hangs up before the call is answered. After some time she phones back and reports the encounter, which is duly noted in the police blotter, but not acted upon. Only an alert reporter from the Vancouver Columbian catches the brief note and looks up the family. This reporter and several Sasquatch investigators canvas the surroundings and neighbors and come up with a few additional items. Two sets of foot prints are found, 12\\\" long and 6\\\" long, whereupon Brenda puts a roast chicken into a high tree fork, since she wants to see the \\\"baby\\\". An adjacent unused meadow has a large depressed area of grass in it. A patch of thimbleberries is found on the steep hillside to have been stripped of its fruit and leaves, leaving bare canes behind. The adjacent farmer's cows, which had just been turned loose for the summer into a higher, lush meadow, come rushing back to the barn that night, something the farmer had never observed before.

It was a short dead end logging road in a recovering clear-cut. We set up camp and went to sleep. Around 2:30 a.m. my wife awoke to our pet rabbit scrambling around in the driver's footwell. The rabbit had gotten down there and couldn't get back up. As my wife reached up there to rescue the bunny, she felt something firmly touch her leg. She described it as a firm press and then deliberate, downward motion. At first she was confused because we were inside the car, but then she remembered that we kept the sliding rear windows open slightly for ventilation. The spot where she was touched was pressed against that opening (we built a sleeping platform in our car that puts us near the level of the windows). She heard nothing super obvious, but immediately afterward she thinks she heard a couple of extremely light footfalls. We stayed mostly silent for about an hour, just listening for anything, but heard nothing else. I finally mustered the courage to peek out a window, but couldn't see anything. The next morning we found very large, muddy fingerprints on our car, near where my wife was touched. We have pictures of these prints which we would be glad to submit. In the photos you can see where I tried to recreate the prints with my own fingers. I have medium sized hands and the prints are MUCH larger. We looked around a bit taking note of things. On my wife's side of the car was only a fairly narrow strip of road, and after that was dry, crunchy grass and brush. Whatever touched her had to be able to walk along that narrow strip, otherwise we would have heard it in the dry brush. It also had to be tall enough to reach the window. We feel these factors probably rule out four-legged animals. We considered the idea that a person could have been messing with us, but there are some issues with that which make us skeptical. First, we feel a person wouldn't have been so quiet. Second, we find it hard to believe someone trying to scare us would have simply touched her leg, left prints, and called it good.

It was facing the road then it spun around counter clockwise and in less than 3 steps was gone back into the timber with its arms swinging as it stepped. I saw him for 2.5 seconds. It was solid black or dark brown. It was very large with huge shoulders. I think he was standing there looking to see if it was safe to cross, then turned around and retreated because of the approaching vehicles. I thought what the heck was that? Did I see what I just saw? It moved like a large man but it is a solid color. I saw one color. It didn\\u2019t have any clothes on. You just start trying to rationalize in your head what you just witnessed. Did I just see a sasquatch? It was hard to believe I seen one. Still is. Sometime before this - maybe 6 months - on the TV news was a story of a tour bus driver up in British Columbia, Canada that had to hit the skids to keep from hitting a Bigfoot that crossed the road in front of him. He quickly opened the door and chased it into the woods. Just inside the woods he ran into it or came face to face with it and it like screamed at him or something. He had to quickly turn tale and run. This was fresh in my mind when I came upon the spot where the creature retreated back into the woods. I slowed my truck down to a slow roll but there was no way I was going to stop and get out to look for tracks or to see if I could see it up close and personal. I wasn\\u2019t going to leave the security of my truck. I looked into the timber best I could as I passed but I didn\\u2019t see him. There was a sedan roughly 100 hundred yards in front of me, half way between me and the creature. No other cars on the stretch. The tail lights never came on when the creature moved and they didn\\u2019t come on when the car approached the spot in the road where the creature stood. It didn't appear to slow at all. I thought how can it be that the car didn\\u2019t see it? They were twice as close to it as I was and the thing was huge. The only thing I can guess is the driver of the car looked down to mess with something on his dashboard and took his eyes off the road for the 2 to 2.5 seconds it took the creature to turn and retreat. I hope they did see it and that they submit a report, too. My next delivery was to an elderly man on Moody Rd. just off of Kirkpatrick Rd. at Humptulips. I was still pretty excited about what I had just seen no more than a half hour before and when I told him what I saw he looked at my like I was on drugs. That was my last stop so when I got back to the warehouse I told my boss Darrell Winters and a coworker Larry Trader what I had just seen. They had a good time laughing at me. That\\u2019s ok, I know what I saw. If I didn\\u2019t see it with my own eyes I would be a skeptic too I guess.\", \"location_details\": \"between Lake Quinault and Neilton on Hwy 101.\", \"county\": \"Grays Harbor County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 7003: Truck driver has brief roadside sighting\", \"latitude\": 47.4259, \"longitude\": -123.8763, \"date\": \"1978-06-21\", \"number\": 7003.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"c0rvv1s5bu\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.8763 47.4259)\"}, {\"observed\": \"On numerous dates listed within the report those witnesses listed above and I had occassion to examine \\\"unusual\\\" scenes which, to date, have been undetermined as to the origin of the evidence found.

On 4-22-82 @ approx. 1609 hrs. I was contacted @ my residence by a private citizen (name witheld @ request) in reference to a number of large tracks found in a fairly secluded area of the eastern portion of Grays Harbor County. The location is known as \\\"Abbott Hill\\\" to the local residents and is rarely traveled or visited. It consists of a two year old \\\"clear cut\\\" of privately owned timberlands surrounded by second growth timber and a heavily vegetated forest floor. There is presently one road around the clearcut and one dividing the clearcut with short spurs off of each. I was escorted to one of these spurs and was shown two large, what appeared to be footprints with human features in an area along the base of a fire trail. The tracks were obviously made after the rains and before the sun had dried the mud as there were virtually no \\\"rain pocks\\\" in the major portion of the track. They were approximately 46\\\" apart and the toes of each track pointed the same direction. No other tracks were visible in the muddy area or along the grassy edge. A distinct trail could be found leading from the top of a small hill, down hill through 8 foot high Salmonberries, Devils club, Blackberries and other intertwined plants. The plants were either broken over entirely or the tops were broken. The trail measured 36\\\" across and was approximately 150' long. It ended on the roadway at the point where the aforementioned tracks were observed. I photographed both tracks and made a plaster cast of the left foot. The tracks measured 15 1/2\\\" long by 6 3/4\\\" wide @ the longest and widest points. (see attachments for further measurements). At the deepest point into the mud, the track measured 1 1/2\\\" deep. This plaster cast was retrieved as evidence by me. A hair was removed from between the second & third toes of the left track & sent to the \\\"Institute of Cryptozoology\\\", in Tucson, Arizona for analyzation. No results have been obtained @ the time of this writing. More tracks were observed, photographed, measured and processed @ the end of the \\\"spur\\\" approximately 1/4 of a mile from the first set of tracks. The longest step @ this location measured 9 feet between steps and only the ball of the foot was distinguishable @ the end of each 9' step. From there a trail of broken vegetation & matted grass went down the hillside into rugged clearcut & drainage. The perimeter road was searched for further sign to no avail. @ the same time I was informed of more tracks located seven miles west of our present location along the Satsop River @ a place called \\\"Worman's Bar\\\". Upon investigation I found two seperate sets of tracks together. Both starting from under the water, traveling westerly and ending in hard packed gravel which made tracking difficult @ best. These tracks were photographed & measured by me. The largest was 17\\\" long by 7 1/2\\\" wide @ the longest & widest points. The smallest was 15 1/2\\\" long by 6\\\" wide @ the longest and widest points. Both sets were made in hard packed river sand and appeared to have been the result of great weight being placed on each foot. The steps measured from 52\\\" down to 39\\\". No casts were made of these due to the lack of plaster of paris. Upon return to the scene with the proper casting materials I found only portions of the tracks due to those made by curiosity seekers. On 4-27-82 I was informed by Officer Jim Young of the Oakville Police Dept. of numerous tracks discovered along the Chehalis River in an area known as \\\"Elma Gate boat launch.\\\" According to Jim, these tracks were followed approximately 1/2 mile upstream. Veryl Hutchinson (Sgt.) and I went to the area where I photographed, measured, and processed the scene. Hutchinson retained the cast of the left foot. The measurement was 15\\\" long by 61/4\\\" wide @ the longest & widest of the left track. Further investigation revealed a trail of approximately one mile. Steps measuring from 59\\\" to 34\\\". On 5-23-82 I was contacted @ my residence by a pastor of a local church and requested to the Porter Creek area for investigation of large tracks sighted in a fairly secluded area of Capitol Forest. I contacted Mike Behm and we met the Pastor and were escorted to the scene. There were four tracks found in the area, numerous photos were taken of the tracks (slide film) and two casts were made of two tracks. Mike Behm retaining one, I the other. An Aspen tree was scratched in such a way indicating five fingers or like items were used to make marks. The lowest mark was located 72\\\" from the ground and the highest was located 98\\\" from the ground. This portion of the tree was removed and is held as evidence. Numerous branches were broken from 8 feet to approx. 11 feet in the trees. A wad of approx. 12 ferns, minus the roots were found @ the creek along with two new growth portions of Aspen branches. A subsequent search of the opposite banks of the creek revealed numerous tracks traveling downstream. The area the tracks were located is a sharp bank, covered with ground salal and devils club. the tracks were followed approx. 1.5 miles and were lost @ the edge of a clearcut. Of the sightings investigated, no two tracks were of the same measurements. The largest distance between the sightings was between the Elma Gate and Abbott Hill, approximately 9 miles. All the sightings indicated something of great weight (600+ pounds) with steps varying from 32\\\" between to 59\\\" between (barring the two of 9' between each). At the Porter Creek and Elma Gate scenes there was evidence of obvious foraging. @ all the scenes there was evidence of great height and weight and a lack of tracks to indicate the evidence was placed there as a hoax.

To liven things up a bit, and perhaps scare a few people, he and I had decided that I would sneak to the field on foot, unbeknownst to our classmates, and give a few blows on the call, which mimics a dying rabbit, while he would tell \\\"sasquatch\\\" stories. After sneaking into position, it was dark and about 10:00pm, I hid along the edge of the field and blew the call as loud as I could.  After a few attempts at attracting attention and realizing that nobody could hear me over the loud music blasting, I was ready to go out and join the party when I heard a branch snap right directly behind me.  Armed only with a flashlight, I turned around and shined it right directly into the face of a male sasquatch standing about 10 feet away!

Only our immediate family knows and in fact a cousin has prompted me to submit this story now. My brother and I along with our wives decided to take a weekend drive up to Wynoochee Lake. We were driving in separate vehicles. When we finally reached the Dam we found that the light rain had started turning to snow. We all decided it would be fun to drive to a higher elevation so we could get out of the slush and enjoy a better view. We noticed that a Ranger in the area had just opened the seasonal locked gate that takes you up to Weather Wax peak. NOBODY had yet drove up this road for at least 6 months. The Ranger had only unlocked the gate and drove away. (His truck tracks in the snow showed this, and it was the 1st of Oct. which is the day the gate is opened as posted.)We drove all the way to the top where the snow was approx. 8\\\" deep. While we were driving along the top East side of the ridge my wife suddenly said \\\"Stop the Truck\\\". She pointed out some strange tracks that came out of the timber down a steep bank across the road and down into a VERY steep draw. My brother and I got out to look at the tracks and could not believe our eyes. I could not imagine anybody walking around way up here and in this kind of weather. The tracks were very fresh and the falling snow had not yet distorted them. Looking closer we could easily make out toes and heal prints. They were very large both in length and width. It was very obvious that these tracks where just made. My brother walked up the bank and had to nearly jump from track to track to make the stride! It wasn't until we walked over to the other side of the road and looked down into where this thing went that fear started settling in. My wife began to get upset and wanted to leave right away. We could tell the tracks were very fresh and decided to get back in our trucks and leave. We talked about what we saw all the way back home and for the next couple of weeks. About 6 or so months later we were astonished to hear of Bigfoot searchers with helicopters based at the dam. They were even on national TV!

The road is a two lane road, with wide shoulders that could easily be additional lane width, so in essence the road is 4 lanes wide.

It has been a while, so I can't be completely sure of the exact dates. One of my older sisters, and her three young duaghters were out looking for a place to pick wild blackberries with my younger sister. There were blackberries in abundance there, which was kind of odd, considering it was so close to the road, and there were many people out picking berries that time of year. They picked berries for just a few minutes when they began to feel uneasy, like there was someone watching them. The girls started to get scared, and one of them said it was a scary place, which was unusual, since it was a nice summer day, and the spot seemed pleasant enough, down by the river. After a few moments, their uneasiness turned to outright fear, and they decided to waste no time leaving. My younger sister related the events of the day to me when she got home that evening, and being curious about such things, we decided to make another trip out there the following day, so I could experience the oppressive atmosphere first hand. We lived in Hoquiam at the time, and got a late start, so it was full dark when we arrived the next evening. But my sister, her husband and myself were somewhat prepared, having brought flashlights, and a point and shoot 35mm camera. It was a walk of about 300 yards from the side of the road to the river, and the going was made a bit difficult because of the downhill slope, and the fact that it rained a couple of days earlier, and the track was all mud, quite deep in parts. We walked / slipped down to the edge of the river bank, and stopped to observe the area. It was very dark, and seemed quite isolated, but other than that, it felt normal, no sense of impending doom, no unseen presence felt. We idled around there for about ten minutes, and were about to go home, when all of a sudden there was a tremendous BANG, it sounded very much like a shotgun at first, and we thought somebody was shooting at us. We ducked, and begin to make our way back to the car, when we heard a very loud splashing just off the shore on our side of the river. It sounded to me like a cow or large deer had fallen in, and was struggling to swim. Being young and foolish, I thought this would make a very cool picture, so I made my way to the bank, and was about to peer over the edge to get my shot, when the thrashing ceased, and there was the very distinct sound of a large rock being thrown into the water. This was quickly followed by another, and soon another. I turned to my sister, and she said, \\\" Oh my God, there's someone throwing rocks!\\\", and by this time her \\\"brave\\\" husband was already well on his way back up to the car at a dead run, and we were right on his heals in a mad panic, slipping and sliding up the dark hill. After a few moments, sanity returned to my sister, and she grabbed my arm and said \\\"wait, listen.\\\", and we stopped a few yards up the track and listened. Now you may be wondering why the sound of some rocks being thrown in the water freaked us out so much. This area was quite desolate, and the river is very cold and deep, with eddies that could easily pull you under and drown you. The river bank is quite steep, and it's an almost sheer 25 foot or so drop to the water, with no easy footing when the tide is in and the river is up. So anybody that would be crazy enough to stand out in the middle of nowhere, in the dead of night by a dark dangerous river, and casually throw VERY large rocks into the water, was not the kind of person we wanted to meet at that time. It just felt very wrong, and our instincts told us to leave NOW! Anyway, we stood there listening for a moment, when my sister grabbed my arm again, and yelled something to the effect, \\\" Oh my God it's coming!!\\\", and she ran off up the hill in a blind panic, and although I didn't see or hear anything, I decided to follow her. We made it up to the car, having slipped and fallen in the mud several times, and beat on the door for her husband to unlock it and let us in. We sat in the car for a few minutes, gathering our wits, and decided to get out and have another listen, since nothing seemed to have followed us up. We stayed close to the car this time, and heard no more splashing at the river, but after a few moments we heard a single, large branch snap in the woods off to our right. It was silent for a few more moments, and we heard a soft rustling in the brush from the same area. I told my Brother in law to throw a rock in that direction, to see if we get any response, and he tossed a fairly sizable stone into the general area, and we heard a bit more commotion. I yelled \\\" Hello there\\\" to make sure we weren't tossing rocks at a person, and got no answer. I then whistled, and heard the strangest sound I have ever heard, before or since. Whatever was in the brush attempted to mimic my whistle. It didn't blow air through it's lips, but tried to vocalize it. I don't know how to describe it, it was somewhat high pitched, but had very deep undertones, and you could tell this thing had some incredible lung capacity, it wasn't even straining, yet had a volume several times louder than my own. This disturbed us quite a bit, and we decided to leave. We returned the next night, and brought four other people with us, and within a few minute of darkness, it would get very quiet, and then the rock throwing would start. Sometimes on our side of the river, and sometimes on the other side. We returned to the area several times, with several different people, and always heard something. I won't detail all the instances here, but will note some of the stranger occurrences. After about our third visit there, we noticed a different phenomenon, just after dark, we would hear the sound of large rocks being clicked together, usually starting on the far side of the river, and then answered with similar clicking from off in the woods on our side. Several times we tried to duplicate the sound, but it always sounded bigger and louder, no matter how large of rocks we could bang together. Several times we heard snapping and rustling in the brush off to both sides. We went there in the daylight to look for anything unusual, but could find nothing out of the ordinary. One interesting note: we never seen nor heard anything unusual in the daylight. Even on bright moonlit nights, we often would hear nothing. My theory is this thing was nocturnal, and if there was even a remote possibility of seeing it, it would keep quiet. The only time anybody saw anything strange there, was when my younger sister and I were left alone at the site for a few hours, waiting for our ride to return. We were standing at the river bank, basically just enjoying the sunset, when my sister said, \\\" Holy S***t, it's bigfoot!\\\", and pointed to the far bank. I looked where she was pointing, but was too late, it had already disappeared into the brush. My sister told me she was scanning a gravel bank we had just noticed earlier that day, when a large black object she had assumed was a stump, or piece of a log which had washed onto the gravel, suddenly stood up, and took three quick steps toward the woods, and was gone. The sun was almost down, and the gravel bank was in deep shadows, so she could make out very little detail, but she said it was defiantly not a cow or bear. She said it walked on two legs, and she got the impression it was walking hunched over, and that it had no neck, and massive shoulders, that the body seemed almost impossibly bulky. She said it moved very fast, like it knew we were there, and it was trying to sneak away. Apparently, it was bent over on the gravel bar for some time, she noticed it when she first looked that way, and it was several minutes before it got up and moved. She seemed quite shaken by the event, and it was a long wait while it got dark, us there alone with no way out, and no car to hide in. I don't think we returned there after that, My sister moved back to Florida where her husband was stationed, and I got a job there driving truck. I moved back to Washington a couple years ago, and last summer decided to return to the area, to see if there was any activity. The first time I went back, I brought along another sister, her husband and their 14 year old son. We arrived at the site after dark again, I had trouble finding after such a long time. This was in the middle of July, and the moon was quite bright, and we hardly even need our flashlights. We walked down to the river bank, and I noticed how the place hadn't really changed at all over the years. We stood there for about half an hour, listening to the frogs and other night critters, and heard nor felt anything unusual, so we decided to leave. I had pretty much figured that whatever was down there back then had moved on, but I wasn't quite ready to give up. We returned the following weekend, and this time it was cloudy and pitch black. We walked down to the river once again, and stood there talking for about ten minutes, when my nephew said, \\\"Shh, listen.\\\", and we did, and heard nothing, and I was about to say that I don't hear anything, when that's when I realized that was what he was talking about. It had suddenly got very quiet, all the frogs quit croaking, and the atmosphere felt dead calm. It began to feel very eerie, and then things happened so quickly, I have trouble recalling the exact events to this day. Two things happened almost simultaneously, we heard the yap of a single coyote, very close by, which was strange, they almost always travel in packs, then we heard something very large, scrambling up the bank, no more than 20 feet away. We all began to run, because whatever it was, was coming right towards us, and fast! I got a sudden case of the braves, and said \\\" Don't run!\\\", then heard very definite, heavy footsteps in the brush, no more than ten feet away, and still coming after us, and said, \\\"Okay, maybe jog!\\\", and we proceeded to hightail it up to the car. We sat in the Blazer for a few minutes with the windows down, listening, and heard nothing further, but none of us wanted to walk back down to river that night. The experience had me so fired up, that I bought one of the new Sony handycams, with the nightshot infrared systems the next weekend, and was determined to get some evidence. We went out there that Saturday armed with my new video camera, and stalked around until looking for tracks or anything until it started to get dark. We found nothing as the ground there is not conducive to track retention, being mostly gravel, weeds or deep brush. It seemed to avoid the muddy track completely. We were at the river bank just after dark, when we heard a single loud splash, and then heavy steps and brush crashing as something made it's way up the bank towards us. I should note, that earlier that day we climbed down the bank to the place it always seems to come from, and it was so rough and steep, it took us several minutes to make our way back up the bank, and that was keeping to the trail, this always came through the heavy brush. My sister and nephew ran off towards the truck, and I walked quickly backwards, filming as I went, hoping to get video of it as it emerged from the brush. It stayed just within the brush, and thus out of sight from me, and it stopped chasing me after I retreated about halfway up the hill. I was feeling brave behind the lens, and started to advance back toward it, and heard to more heavy steps in my direction, and got the distinct impression that I should leave now. We got back in the truck and left, and haven't returned since. My sister feels it's too dangerous to go back, and I won't go there alone. Whatever it is, it's very territorial, I get the feeling that it was charging us to get us out of the immediate area, and then when we got back to the vehicle, it was okay. The experiences I've had this time are much different than the first time. There was no rock splashing or rock clicking this time, just a sudden, and I feel very aggressive charge to get us out of there. I haven't been there since the first part of August of 1998, and would very much like to return to the site with somebody that has more experience in these things than I do. If there are any serious researchers in the area that are interested in this site, let me know and perhaps I can take you there.

I was on an old logging road and was watching a cleared area for deer when from across the draw I observed someone come out of the tree line on the other side of the draw. At first I thought it was a very large man as it seemed to move as one, walking quite comfortably as though it were strolling on a road. I am aware of the roads in this area and was surprised to see that there was a road there. As I looked closer I realized this \\\"PERSON\\\" was far taller than a human and the strides while walking were quite long. It seemed to move along as though on a hard flat surface which is why I had the impression at first that there was a road there. It was a varied color of browns with what appeared to be lighter almost gray brown head and shoulders giving the impression that it was mature. After observing for several seconds it turned towards me as though it just realized I was there and then turned back to the treeline and easily! moved back into them. Still thinking that I couldn't have seen what I saw, I went across to the treeline where he entered just sure I was going to find a road and a fellow hunter up there. I discovered no road and a uneven difficult ground cover. When I entered the trees where I saw this thing go in I discovered that just through the trees was another draw that was very steep and un-hikable. Having never gave thought to Sasquatch possibilities before I was truly amazed to find that I saw one. I was hunting with my son and a friend but they were not in the area when I saw this. I am positive that I saw something definately not human but quite graceful on two legs. I was not sure if I should tell anyone of this as the thought of disbelievers and coming from a small made me a bit aprehensive. I did tell my hunting buddy and my son, but even took a few days to tell my wife. I feel honored to have been blessed with this sighting and have wanted to have wanted to report it. Until now I had let it slide so to speak but last night saw a show on Sasquatch and after seeing a film of one walking it confirmed my belief that I truly saw what I saw.

When you drive down the highway there are signs directing people to drive up in the nearby hills in case of tidal waves. It was up these dirt roads that my husband and I were hunting. The weather was cold in the morning, there was frost on the ground, by noon it had warmed up and was mild out. This is written from the view of someone who at the time of this incident knew very little of big foot, and really didn't give them any thought. We encountered a bear hunter early in the morning that told us he had spotted bear sign the day before and was back to continue the hunt. He also commented to us that this was the worst smelling bear he had ever tracked. By late morning he had his bear and we again spoke with him. I put my head in the canopy of his truck to look at the bear and did not notice any foul smell. My husband and I continued hunting for deer. We decided to split up. He dropped me off at an old overgrown road and was going to drive over to the one that ran parallell to it. The plan was for me to walk out slowly to the clear cut then go to the right and meet up with him. As I reached the edge of the clearcut, I stopped to scan for deer. I started from the right slowly looking to the left, nothing. As I stepped out of the cover of the brush to my left, about 100 yards away, underneath the branches of a fir tree and back against the trunk, I saw what looked exactly like the face of a big foot. Now I had never given much thought to these things but this looked so much like one that I froze in my tracks. I was so scared that it took me fifteen minutes to drop my pack, which I was carrying in my left hand, and pick up my binoculars that were hanging from my neck. I had to talk my self into moving. I told my self that it was probably a stump under the tree. I got my binoculars to my eyes and looked at it and it still looked exactly like the pictures you see that people draw. It looked like it was crouching down trying to hide from view underneath the branches. The tree was not big maybe 20 feet tall. It looked like it was staring right at me. I thought from the first that this thing was a threat to me. I knew nothing of them and was very afraid. Well, I finally decided I could get one shot off before it got to me, my rifle is a bolt action, and I'm not very fast on the draw; it didn't help that I was shaking like a leaf. If I made it to the end of the road, then I would be in sight of my husband, who is a very good shot. Keep in mind that this line of reasoning was the fear of the unknown. I came out to where I could see my husband and waved to him while walking fast to meet up with him. I told him that there was something under a tree that looked exactly like the sasquatch pictures. He asked if I wanted to go back and check it out, I said no. I was happy to be back in his company. It was late afternoon by this time and we decided to hunt the right end of the clear cut. He left me sitting against a dirt mound looking across the end of the clear cut. My husband went farther to the right on the next hillside so he could watch the same area. I didn't feel afraid because the truck was just down the road less than 25 yards and I would just go get in if anything happened. We were both watching the clear cut and it was almost too dark to shoot, when across the cut where the edge of the old growth timber was still standing came the the loudest howling, screaming carrying on that I have ever heard. My husband described it like the howling of a coyote having its legs wrenched off but far to loud for a coyote to make. I can only describe it as a wall of screaming and howling that came up from the valley floor and blanketed everything, there was no place that howling, screaming wasn't. I sat forward and thought what the heck is that. The sound was coming from in front of where my husband was hunting, we estimate this to be 400 yards. I stayed put but was straining to see what was screaming like that in the corner of the woods, which would be maybe 600 yards from my position. It seemed to be staying just inside the tree line so we couldn't see it. After about twelve minutes of this my husband stood up to leave. When he did the screaming abruptly ended, there was dead silence.....not a sound anywhere. He came back to where I was and we decided it was time to leave. We did not do any investigating of sasquatch until two years later when my husband and his relatives were hunting up at Rim Rock lake and had another encounter. When we started checking sasquatch noises on the internet that's when we heard again the howls and screams that we had heard in the foothills by the ocean. We also think that the bear hunter smelled a sasquatch not his bear. And that the thing under the tree probably was a sasquatch watching me. We now go out with cameras and tape recorders hoping for another encounter.\", \"location_details\": \"From Hwy 105 turn onto Smith Anderson Road.

My first encounter was 2 years ago with my uncle up towards Humtulips. We were goin hunting for bear and cougar. We had to park right next to the highway at a locked gate and walk in. After walking a while, probably about 2 miles we start goin around this corner and somthing to our right about 50-75yds in front of us in the thick brush started banging what sounded like a rather large stick/club against a tree. We both stopped and looked at each other and I asked him do u hear that and he replyed yes, Then i asked him what it was and he didnt have a clue and I thought that was strange cause he spends every minute he can in the woods, he has his whole life. Then after we stoped for a minute the pounding stoped then we start walking towards it and it started pounding again. The only thing going through my mind was bigfoot, so just to be safe I loaded a 30-06 cartridge into my chamber. Every little bit we would stop and the pounding would stop until we got right up to it. We looked around but couldnt see anything it was so thick and we listened for somthing to take off running but we never heard anything so we proceeded on and never heard anything from it again. After I got home I was thinking about it and I thought maybe it was a bear slamming a smaller tree onto a fallen log but bigfoot just stuck in my head for some reason I knew it wasnt a bear, it was just to weird, then about a month later on the news there was a bigfoot expert on and he described what I heard exactly. He said he thinks that it is a warning of some kind. The next 3 happened all last year in 2000. The first one of the year was when me and 2 friends were camping out at Humptulips. We have been sitting around the campfire for a while now with LOUD music playin the whole time we were there and it was about 1am and we all decided to get some sleep so we got in the tent and we were layin there for about 5 maybe 10 min at the most and somthing about 30ft from our tent picked up a rather large rock and dropped it on the ground, i sat up right away and said did u guys hear that and only one of my friends did so I grabbed a flashlight and went out there and there was nothing to be seen, but it wouldnt be that hard to hide when its pitch black out and theres woods all around. Everyone says it was probably somthing just kicked a rock, It wasnt, somthing picked up a rock and dropped it. It didnt skip on the ground like if something would have kicked it, it was one solid thud. If you know somthin that would or could pick up a rather large rock and just drop it I would like to hear from you cause the only thing I can think of it being is bigfoot. The second encounter was with my friend deer hunting. We were out in the black creek area and we pulled up to this clearing and got out of the truck and not even 30 seconds out I heard the pounding like with my first encounter 2 yrs ago, we sat there for a little bit listening and it kept goin and wasnt stopping so we decided to try and find it. We went down the road and stopped every once in a while to listen for it and we finally found a canyon closer to it then another one started but then the first one got farther away. It was like they were communicating by it, one would pound on a tree then stop then the other one would start. We never did find them it was starting to get dark so we decided to head home and that was the last of that one. I havent been back to that area since but i plan on it soon. The third encounter was out in north river on the c line. I was elk hunting with my grandpa and we took a spur off the main road and we drove down and found a beaver pond frozen and we stopped and ate and bout 15min later we started to head back out and my grandpa looked down a dead end spur and we got just past it and he slammed on his breaks and said I just seen bigfoot so he put it in reverse and went back fast but it was gone. So we drove down to take a look and but couldnt find it although we found about 5 grouse beds and a pile of grouse feathers and a grouse leg in the middle of it, the feathers were in a neat pile and i thought that was wierd. Then as im looking around I found one visible track from the bigfoot and it was bigger than the size 13 boot I was wearing and I can also see a trail of footprints not very clear prints but they were leading back into the woods with grouse feathers from a different grouse on the trail. Im looking around in the trees and i can see where it was sneaking around through the trees up to the grouse, so we must have caught it when it was eating. Not right when I got there but after a little bit of looking around I noticed a smell, it wasnt very strong like ive heard of a bigfoot smell but there definatly was a different smell there.

While picking the berries on the end of a spur road that cut across a hill side I heard what was wood knocking, It sounded like two pieces of hard wood being knocked together, the first time was three knocks in rapid succession one after another then a pause and some more knocking, it was very unusual. I have been in the woods all of my life. And have heard grouse thump, Elk call, and bugle, and deer snort and even bark at you. But have never heard something like this. The spur I was on is West to East, East being the end of the spur where I was picking the berries. After hearing this wood knocking, I walked West back up the road and could tell the knocking was coming from the ridge above me. I thought it had to be coming from another human being because nothing else could make a noise like that. Banging two pieces of wood together had to be a human event. BUT I was out in the middle of the forest. At least 7 miles from the nearest house and only one house at that. I had been up and down all the surrounding roads and spurs already picking berries and knew there were no other vehicles in the area, so no one else was out there, I was alone. So what could it be? I had no clue I wanted to climb the ridge to investigate but it was very steep and very thick with dog hair, or second growth hemlock. So I decided against that, The wood knocking continued as I walked back to the truck, It was to a little strange so I just left the area.

As I was driving, I was enjoying the view to my left and just caught a glimpse of a decent sized animal that darted from right to left across the road and into the left ditch, where I lost sight of it as I drove past.  As I drove I continued to look to my left to take in the view when movement near the road ditch to the left side of my truck caught my attention.

The logging road we were on takes you out to the Wynoochie lake. A friend of mine and I were driving out to meet some friends who were camping. They were a few miles back off the paved road. We stopped the truck to get out and check the bed to make sure we had everything before we got too deep out in the woods. Like food, beverages etc.. It was just getting dark so we had the headlights on and the dome light lit up everything around us, so we couldn't see a few feet (10+ or so from the truck). We both get in the truck about the same time and close the doors, dome light goes off and we notice something standing roughly 15-20' ahead of us, in the middle of a single lane logging road. We were in a lifted Toyota Tacoma, I'm about 6'4 and the truck was taller than me. What we saw was grey-ish brown colored and fully covered in hair. The part of the road we were parked was cut out from a small hill. The banks were roughly 6' high on each side of the road. Before we could take a picture, honk, do anything at all, from a standing position it jumped up and was up and over the bank. The headlights didn't show the exact height but in my guess it had to be at LEAST 7'. I'm over 200lbs and it made me look like a baby. To this day, I still haven't gone down that logging road. If you'd like to know the exact place, it is called the A-Line on top of 13 corners. We were traveling from Wishkah side so the road was on our left.

I walked onto my back porch and noticed an unrecogizable sound. Since I'm into nature observation and tracking, and had heard audio recordings of alleged Sasquatch vocalizations, this possibility was in the back of my mind. I walked to the edge of the ravine and listened intently to the patterns of barks and growls. They were more audible than any canine and had an order to them which reminded me of sogbirds, repeating notes over and over. They didn't sound like any coyotes or elks or other fauna. I went into a slight panick at the thought of it being a Sasquatch, which I was sure it was. I ran back to my house as fast as I could and grabbed my tape recorder which I usually use for recording bird songs. I spent the next twenty minutes waving the microphone into the night air. I then went back inside to see if it was working, but found to my dismay that the battery in the microphone was dead! By the time I got it working, the animal had stopped vocalizing. Throughout this twenty minute period, several dogs gradually began barking with greater and more frequent intensity. It was interesting to contrast the difference in the dogs barking to the complex patterns of the alleged Sasquatch noises. The sounds were more structured, they had a greater range of expression and caried further through the forest. The next day, I went out on foot to the spot and found the broken and trampled branches, the ripped tarp, the coyote carcass, the dog food bowl and the unknown animal scat. I surmised this was a form of territorial marking. Perhaps the Bigfoot picked up the items from a backyard or killed the coyote. There didn't appear to be any recent human activity there. There were no regular trails, the terrain was steep, and slippery, the nearest house about 800 feet away.

Sorry for the delay but what I saw doesn't seem explainable other than a sasquatch. I was staying at a place called Mariner Village about 5 miles south of Ocean Shores. It's about 1/4 mile from the north jetty at Browns Pt. The time is about 1:30am (I knew this because I had just left my room at 1:20 am to return to my fire on the beach). My back was to the ocean watching the fire. I turned to look at the ocean (which was about 30 yards away) and saw what I thought was a person walking south along the water line down the beach. The moon was full and when I first saw it, it was directly west of me. What I could see was a dark figure from about mid-torso up because the beach slopes down quite a bit in that area. It appeared to be just a person out for a late night/early morning stroll on the beach. So I decide to follow them, maybe go talk to them and start walking at an angle down the beach to cut them off. Seeing that I wasn't catching up to them I start running down the beach still at an angle in there direction. It was hard to make out detail while running so I stopped to get a better look. That's when I realized the following, with the full moonlight I could see only it's upper body and it was all black, it had no neck, looked like it was wearing a hooded sweatshirt. I start running again as fast as I could. This thing was fast, it must have covered the 1/4 mile from where I first saw it down to about 50 yards from the jetty in about a minute and a half. I stop running and I could see it way down the beach about 200 yards away. It stopped about 50 yards from the jetty turned and faced the ocean. It was at an area on the beach that I saw it's feet turn towards the incoming waves. It's movements seemed very unnatural and overexagerated. When it turned towards the ocean it flexed it's back like it was leaning backwards. It seemed like it was looking back to see where I was. I know it saw me standing by the fire, I had a white t-shirt on and a shaved head, and probably saw me go after it, that's why it got down the beach so fast. It moved off and when it got near the shadow of the jetty I lost sight of it. That's when I decided to turn around and go back. Tried to find tracks but it was moving along the water line at high tide, the waves would have covered them up. The next day I took my friend told him to go stand down by the water and stood in the spot I first saw it, I could barely see the top of his head. Like I said I didn't report this for awhile because it's hard to fathom this happening in such a populated area. But considering the surrounding area, Oyhut State Game Refuge is very close and only 6 miles away is thick forested area to the north,one of these creatures could travel that distance easily in the cover of darkness. Once it got to that jetty it leads to the game refuge.

We ended up getting lost but knew the A and B line roads (which we were on from what the Garman told us) came out somewhere near Capitol forest.

I. had stopped the truck and opened his door and gotten out because whatever it was was at about a 35 deg angle on the left side not even 100 yrds away from us and my boyfriend sitting on my right had no clue what was going on.

I keep my cameras handy while we are driving almost anywhere out of our town.  I like to shoot candid photos of the sights we see. On June 2, 2012, we reached a curve just south of Seabrook (a newly built, planned community).  My husband pulled over and I turned to look up at the rather bare fir trees standing on the top of the ridge on the east side of the coast road.  I always enjoy looking at those weather bleached trees and have captured their a number of times.  When my eyes moved down to the lower part of the trees, just uphill from our parking spot, I saw a head and shoulder-like shape standing between two trees.  The brush on the hillside hide all but the head and top of part of the shoulder shapes...  I quickly reached for my 'ready to shoot' camera, with its 70-300mm tele-lens, but by the time I aimed the camera at that spot...the head/shoulder shape was no longer 'there'.  I told my husband what I'd just seen...but he didn't seem too impressed. So, I stepped out of our SUV to shoot some photos looking downhill and out over the beach below our rather high vantage point.  I shot several, including some of wildflowers blooming nearby my husband's driver-side door.  When I was about to walk back around the car to get into it...a sudden loud noise struck nearby.  I immediately looked toward the wide-metal guard-rail, since the loud noise sounded like a heavy stone hitting metal...leaving a vibrating sound. I saw no stones on the paved parking area...but a stone could have skipped over into the grass and brush just beyond the railing. I don't know what caused that loud noise...but it was unnerving enough for my husband, who does have a hearing problem, to suddenly tell me to get back into the car.  He had heard it also. While first parked in that area...we had also seen a large pickup truck suddenly stop just below us right on the curve of the highway...while it was traveling north, as had we been just minutes earlier.  The truck was not sitting in a safe place...it we noted that it made no sense for it to stop in such a blind-spot on a curved in a busy roadway...  The truck had then moved forward 20 to 30 ft. and then suddenly stopped a second time...and hesitated for several seconds before starting on its way once more.  Later...my husband and I speculated that the truck might also have been struck by a rock/stone thrown from that same hillside... Our rock incident was the second one I know of that occurred within the same week...

The witness does not own a computer. I had been helping some neighbors with a repair, and since I don\\u2019t drive anymore, they took me home. It was about 2:00PM on Dec 26th 2012. The car had several people in it when they dropped me off. I was up on my porch, getting my keys out to open the front door when I heard screaming coming from the car which was still in the driveway. Wondering what they were arguing about, I turned to look at them, and saw that they were frantic, pointing to the back of my yard. I turned to look at what they were pointing at, when I saw a very large, hairy, upright form crossing a little cut in the brush at the back of my lot. There were three deer with it, two in front and one behind. That seemed strange. The deer were unconcerned. We have a huge population of deer here. I knew immediately what it was\\u2026.a bigfoot. I noted a tree limb that was even with its head. One step and it was gone. I went out there and marked the limb where its head was with a piece of white rag. The next week, on January 3rd around 2:30PM, I was out at the back of my property with my loppers. I was cutting a trail through the very thick brush so that I could get to the next street easier. There are narrow deer trails and I was on one of those. I smelled something really bad. It was like a ripe garbage can. I made my way in that direction, clipping branches, when suddenly I saw something on the ground in about 6-8 feet in front of me. At first, I couldn\\u2019t see what it was, and then it moved. I was frozen in fear. I am on oxygen, and knew I could not run. This thing arose to hands and knees. It was hairy and brown, with silver gray hair on its back. It reminded me of a giant pile of steel wool. I thought it was a bear at first. It was supporting itself on its right hand and knees. The left hand was off the ground. It turned its head and upper body to look left and looked at me. My fear level was a 10! I dropped my loppers without moving. He then looked away from me, shifting his weight to his left hand. He brought his right hand up in front of him and rubbed his thumb on his fingers while he looked right, then forward as if he were reasoning out which way to go. Then he looked back at me, but his expression changed, and my fear level dropped. He looked intelligent. After a few seconds of considering what to do, he took off in the direction he was facing, straight ahead. On all fours he slithered along the ground, going under limbs and up a little rise for about 15 feet. Then I saw him stand up momentarily, and then duck down and dart away to the right. It was at that moment that I decided to run, to heck with the consequences. I made it back to my yard and about halfway to the house when I collapsed. After resting, getting my breath, and collecting my wits, I went back there. I found what I think is a hand print, and placed a bucket over it to preserve it. After thinking things over, the next evening, I called the police. Two officers were there within minutes. They arrived around 6:30PM. They were very re-assuring. They said to not worry, and to just tell them what happened, as they see strange things all the time. I told them what happened. They stayed with me for a couple of hours. They did not make fun of me and were supportive and re-assuring. I don\\u2019t own a computer, and don\\u2019t even know how to turn one on. I started asking around for some friends in real-estate to look for some organization to report this to. Eventually, someone found your number and gave it to me.

From experience I know that if one deer crosses the road there is a good chance that another is right behind it and so I slowed way down.  Instead of a deer, here comes this guy that makes it across the road in three strides at a dead run.  I came to a complete stop, somewhat in shock...like \\\"what the HELL am I looking at?\\\" This guy (yup it was a male, no question about that..)stops at the top of the roadside berm, turns around and looks right at me.  He gave me a grin that was CLEARLY a threat, turned back around and vanished into the roadside brush. So I got to see a Sasquatch up close and personal.  My window was down and I was no more than 20 feet from him.  His face was human looking except that he had no chin and he had a somewhat heavy brow ridge.  The nose was a human nose and was more european than african looking.  The eyes were black, the skin was grey as was his hair and he had more or less human teeth...what was left of them.  His teeth were in terrible condition.  When he ran, his palms were down, not thumbs up like us, and when he stood his palms faced back rather than thumbs forward like a person.  The arms looked a bit longer than a human but not more than half a hand length longer.  Also since it was around one in the afternoon and I was looking south at him I could see the shape of his head through the hair in the sun.  The hair sticks way up and makes him look like he has a pointy head but really the shape of the head is human.  My guess and it is only a guess,  is that he was about 7-8 feet tall.

I grabbed the two small pots and stood up and yelled at the dog to \\\"shut up\\\" just then the bushes in front of me started thrashing like crazy and deep growl/grunt/exhale emanated from behind them. It was surreal as sound seemed to penetrate right through me, whatever it was, it wasn't happy. Instinctively, I started to cover the distance to my shed about 35 feet and while I was on my way, I could feel/hear the ground pounding as \\\"whatever\\\" was moving for cover in the brush to the south. It was like \\\"boom, boom, boom, boom then it crashed into the woods and there was loud sound of sticks/branches breaking...

My friend and I hiked up the Mt. Jupiter trail to go fly fishing at one of the Jupiter Lakes, which I think might be referred to as #2.  You drop down over the ridge to the north before getting to the summit of Mt. Jupiter to reach the first 3 of 5 lakes I believe.  There is no trail to the lakes, so you must drop over the ridge to get down to the first lake, sometimes hanging on to a bit of brush.  There are 3 lakes on this side.  We got to the first, followed the outlet and went and camped at the 2nd lake down.  I think we stayed two nights.  It was probably the 2nd day when this incident happened.  There were some other guys that had camped on the other side of the lake and had left about 2-3 PM I recall.  My time frames are not exactly clear anymore.  Nonetheless, the guys that had been camping on the opposite side of the lake had left about 3 hours previous to what I call a \\u201cdidn\\u2019t pay enough attention encounter\\u201d.  I was fly fishing the shoreline sort of off to the side on the opposite end of the lake.  Being an intense fly fisherman concentrating on my fishing, I saw what was, I thought at first, a person had returned to the camp to get something they might had forgotten.  I didn\\u2019t pay any attention because I had remembered there were people that had camped there.   At the moment, while concentrating fishing, I didn\\u2019t look directly at the camp, but saw a figure out of the corner of my eye.  It was probably their for a minute or maybe less.  Out of the corner of my eye, this figure, walked back and forth maybe a couple of times in the area and finally walked with a large stride, across the campsite and disappeared into the woods.  After it had disappeared, the thought of the stride struck me as odd.  It was a big stride, arms swinging, just as the video of the sasquatch that was spotted in the late 60\\u2019s down in Eureka, California.  After it had disappeared, the oddness of the stride made me look over at the campsite.  Then it hit me how very odd it seemed because of the movement and stride of the figure out of the corner of my eye.  I was actually upset for not taking a better look, and further upset because I had my camera quite handy at the time.  I carry it to take pictures of trout I catch.  I don\\u2019t remember where my friend was at the time since it was a long time ago, but anyway, I told him about it.  I said let\\u2019s go over there and see if we can find some tracks, so we did.  When we got there we discovered the campsite area was a huge rock mass with moss growing on it.  We found no tracks, but we didn\\u2019t look that hard either.  I must say, that we could hardly sleep that night.  Nothing more unusual happened that I can recall.  I had seen the film of the sasquatch spotting down in Eureka by the Patterson guy, long before this hiking/fishing trip, so the swinging of the arms and stride had sort of stuck in my mind and this thing, whatever it was, had that same movement.  Too bad I didn\\u2019t look straight at it\\u2026too bad I didn\\u2019t snap a photo.  I regret it to this day.  I can say that the creature coloring was a brownish reddish color.  It didn\\u2019t dawn on me until after this thing disappeared, that I didn\\u2019t see any clothing from the \\u201ccorner of the eye\\u201d observation encounter\\u2026  I just thought I should report this after all these years.  I never have.  I can say that the area is very rugged country and is not easy to get to.  The campers on the north side of the lake had come somewhere up from the Dosewallips River where I don\\u2019t know of any trail access, so they must have \\u201cbushwacked\\u201d to get to the lakes from that side.\", \"location_details\": \"As described above.

Thinking it to be another hunter walking heavily to alert others that might be in the area that he was coming through the cover. I stopped on the road waiting for the person to appear so I could acknowledge his presence, and he, mine. What appeared in an opening was what I thought at first to be a bear. It was standing upright and when it came into view, it spotted me immediately, turned toward me and froze. It stood there for only a few seconds, then suddenly turned to its left and disappeared. It made absolutely no noise when it left. I later went down to where I had seen it to look for tracks. It had come up an old overgrown logging road and the ground was hard packed with tufted grass laying over. I could find no tracks and couldn't even make any myself. I was an absolute non-believer in Sasquatch and Flying Saucers and I had difficulty accepting what I had seen. I went to the camper and returned with my wife to where I had stood when I saw this thing. I asked Val to go to the spot where I had seen the animal so I could judge its size.

I was hunting alone on an old logging road I'd picked because it went into the mountains the farthest. Due to my job (ARMY), I arrived late, just before sundown just as a couple were hauling up the last piece of an elk doe his wife had shot that morning.   He was still cussing her because she watched it cross the road in front of her and waited until it got to the bottom of the ravine before shooting it.  Well they left and I spent the night in my truck.   All night it snowed lightly, which is great for tracking. I was parked at the end of NFR 2433, I arose before dawn and just stayed in the back of the truck, I had a clear view down the road for about half a mile. I hadn't seen anything all AM when suddenly I saw what I thought was another hunter step out into the open on a curve in the road about 1000' away. He/it looked at me, walked to the edge of the road overlooking a 500' drop to the valley floor & it just froze there, it looked like it was scanning for game. All I could see besides its outline was its head occasionally scanning. What struck me odd about him at first was no sign of a rifle, he was all black, and very big, even at the distance we were apart.   There being know one else around I figured he'd walk over to me & BS for a while, but he just stood there motionless for a couple of hours! I was starting to creep me out the more I watched him, because I started noticing little things like I could see no signs of a weapon, no bright orange hunting colors or anything that I could differentiate as clothing. I consider it inappropriate to point a high powered rifle w/scope at someone, so I never scoped it out. As there was nothing else to see, I watched him for several hours, and seemingly he never moved!  Finally he took one giant step over the edge going down into the canyon. Its this move that caught my eye, I figured he was going to just sit on a boulder down there.   At this time I still thought it was another hunter.   I figured what the hell, I'll offer him a cup of coffee so I walked slowly down there.   When I got to where he went over the edge, there was nothing there.   That is when the hair stood up on the back of my neck & I started looking for tracks.   The corner he had been was in the sun & all the snow had melted, but only a few yards away, to the south the road was still in the shade, NOT ONE SINGLE TRACK!!   That meant it could only have come out of the deep woods as there was still an unbroken blanket of snow further down the road. The only way he could have got there was down the mountain.   And that meant it wasn't a man. This really creeped me out, I very cautiously crept back to my truck & left the area. Never went back. I now know what I saw was a Squatch, not a man.

I thought I'd finally report my sighting from sometime ago. First off, I have been a military officer and I'm finally ready to retire ( just got my 20 years in the Army Guard) and am a very avid outdoors man.  The year was 1986, mid September on a weekend at about 1 to 2 hrs before evening.  It was very bright out, little to no clouds in the sky.  The temperature was fairly mild to warm.  Sunset may of been coming, it was a beautiful day. Earlier on in the year, there was a show on 60 Minutes (or a similar show) about Vietnam Vets who live in the Olympic Peninsula that live off the grid. The location was mountain side that overlooked Discovery Bay, in between Port Townsend and Sequim in Washington State.   We were all in my little truck driving up to some logging roads to do some target practice.  Two of my military buddies and two of our mutual female friends were crammed in my truck as we arrived to the clear cut area to do some shooting.  Just in case there was some animals in the clear cut area, I parked the truck back from the end of the road so the sound of the truck might not scare any animals.  As Kevin and Mike were fussing, getting the two girls out of the truck and trying to load up the other rifles, I hopped out of the drivers seat with my shotgun and a few rounds and ran up to the overlook. I was very nervous as to what I saw standing on a logged stump about 50 to 60 yards away just down the slope in the middle of the clear cut.   There was what seemed to be a very large man wearing a light brown, dusty looking ghillie suit, with his back to me standing on a stump, just staring at the waters of Discovery Bay.  He (or she) was admiring the sun gleaming off the water.  I seriously thought it was one of those Vietnam Veteran hermits that I heard about on TV. As I stood there, nervous, ...the guys at the truck slammed a door on the truck and then the thing calmly turned around to look up the hill at the sound, then saw me.  It had little neck movement, turning its shoulders with its head.  It moved its feet to turn around on the large stump.  It stared right at me and I stared right back into its eyes.  Then, as it looked at me, I saw total intelligence in its eyes.  I saw that it was not a man wearing a ghillie suit.  I saw its face very well.  It appeared to be a male.  It gave me a calm, peaceful but disgruntled look of 'please be quiet, ..you are annoying'.  As I looked at it, 'he' sized me up and saw that I was no threat to him.  I almost felt that it knew I was no threat.  It definitely had a look of high intelligence.  Anyway, it turned its back at me and continued to stare at the bay.  At that point, my heart jumped into my mouth and I hollered at the guys to get there ass over to where I was and make it fast!  The Bigfoot once again turned around to me again, making the same right hand turn and looked at me for the second time but this time it turned a little faster.  When we locked eyes, it looked even more annoyed or disappointed and maybe a little scared.  It took one long stride off the stump towards the tree line.  It didn't run but it was almost fast walking.  Then appreciating it was between 7.5 to 8' tall, and seeing that huge stride, I hollered to the guys and started running after it.  The guys then saw me sprinting after it over fallen trimmed branches, logs, over stumps with rifle in hand and they knew something big was up.  Before I got half way to it, it already made it into the tree line. My friends never saw it.  All of us re-traced the steps of the thing after I showed them where it was standing.  We saw a few good prints.  All of us heard it snapping a few big 'loud' branches as it took good cover deeper into very thick bushes.  There was a little bit of a unique smell, unlike anything I've ever experienced in terms of an animal's scent.  It was faint but notable.  I couldn't sleep for a week after that.  I wasn't far behind in my chasing of the thing.  I was extremely bewildered at how it could make it through that very dense brush and not slow down.  Maybe it just got out of our view and sat down and hid in the bushes?  Its almost like it just 'phased' away once it got to where it wanted to go like some kind of strange spirit or something.  If it was an elk running into that brush, it would of got slowed to the point that I could gain on it, but that thing just slipped into the foliage.  Anyway, that's my one and only Bigfoot sighting.  I hope you can find this useful info.  Since I'm about to retire, I'm more inclined to tell my story without getting looked at oddly from my military peers.

While at the bog, something dark and large moved behind the reeds/ tall plants there, about 10 yards from where we stood. It could have been a bear, or something that had been crouched down looking for something.Whatever it was, it moved away, and we never got a [good] glimpse of it. On June 19th, we took the hike up to Wolf Bar around 5 o'clock P.M. Twice,on our way up, we heard what sounded like rapping/ tapping on a hollow log, back towards the places on the trail where we had already hiked. Since there was a herd of Roosevelt elk in the area, we didn't think too much about it. When we got to the end of the main trail, we stayed about 15 minutes just enjoying the quiet. There were no other hikers that we passed. We decided to turn back when we began to smell a strange, not very pleasant smell, and heard 3 knocks on what seemed to be hollow wood (this time the sound came from just past the end of the main trail, where we hadn't been.) I kind of joked about the smell, thinking that it was only the shallow water in the stream there. But we had remained at the same place near the trail end, and had not smelled that smell during the prior 15 minutes. The next day, about 7:00 P.M. we took the short hike to Irely Lake. On our way back, the sunlight was getting fairly dim, so we had to watch where we were walking. About 3/4 of the way back, we heard this tremendous sustained roar-growl sound - almost like it was out of a science fiction movie. Not like any bear that we've heard, and certainly not at all like a mountain lion. It was loud, but seemed to be somewhat distant - perhaps 100 or so yards off in the forest. And it never repeated itself. We scurried back to our car and drove home.

First, I must say that I am not easily taken to believing \\\"out there\\\" kinds of stories, but I feel I can explain most things in my environment while other things simply put, defy explanation.  I lived in a 22 ft. travel trailer in the woods just outside of Port Townsend, Washington at the time, which - for this report I will say roughly - was about summer 1998 or so.  It was long after dark and I  was inside writing or something and heard a strange bellowing noise just off through the woods.  It was so different than anything I'd ever heard since I moved there a year or so before that I got up and opened the door and stepped out onto the open porch.  It was a clear and still night and out in the country there it is very dark and very quiet.  I could see the stars so well.  When I heard it the second time I was immediately perplexed by what I was hearing, followed by the kind of sensation where they say \\\"the hairs on the back of my neck stood up\\\".  It sounded like a call from a large beast.  I study music technology and am well familiar with timbre, frequency, and volume and I can honestly say that the type of voice mechanism and size of it's vocal chords/chest cavity had to be at least the size of a large buck to an elk or bear.  I am also a long time, studied and experienced singer.  I do very well at imitating voices and I was struck by this bellowing as being from not only a large animal, but also an animal which must be nocturnal AND trying to communicate.  But with what or who?  So, I only heard the two bellows and after waiting a few minutes, I decided to get a flashlight and walk up the dirt road where the noise was coming from.  I didn't find anything, but I did hear other voices through the woods in the vacinity from which the noise came and I recognized them as coming from a nearby yurt, just on the other side of a small lake from me.  It was in comparison of these voices that I determined that the crys I initially heard were coming from a distance of about 100 to 150 yards.  The only other thing I should mention about the instance is that I lived on the edge of a green belt that runs, unbroken, from Port Townsend city limits, all the way into the Olympic National Park.  Furthermore, my good friend, Todd, living on the same green belt was sleeping outside one night and heard a creature of large size come lumbering up, sticks cracking and brush sweeping and all, and get very close to where he was in a tree- loft, then sat quiet for several minutes before crashing off through the brush, the way it had come. Please understand, I have hiked the deep Olympic Mts. avidly for 12 years.  I've even worked out there at times, and I've never heard anything like the bellowing I heard that night.  And at the risk of sounding cliche or hoaky, that voicing sounded more like wookie, without the rattling throat sound that any other known sound.  But it's true also that after years of hiking and tracking in the mountains, I've never seen a bear or cougar, nor their remains and though I know they are out there, I have only but chanced to stumble upon a fresh cougar den along the Lyre River but nary a single cat in sight. Call it what you will, I say had a sasquatch experience and some of my trusted friends can report similar strange occurances.  Bigfoot, Sasquatch, Browns and Blacks, whatever they call them out here, they're real.  And researcher Grover Crantz recently moved 35 minutes down the road from here in Sequim.

You turn right, and less than a mile later, you turn left on Cook Av.  perhaps half a mile later you round a curve and find Elmira Rd.  On the left.  This is the general vacinity from which the bellowing came from.  The location of the friend's occurance would be the same turn onto Jacob Miller, but then a quick left onto Old Discovery Rd. and taking, I believe, the second right onto Arcadia Rd - then a quick left down this dirt road which I think is unmarked except for red fire markers.

The adults stayed near the campfire area. One group slep under a large rock overhang. I chose to sleep a little away from all their noise of the others. I remember looking up at the stars and the jagged mountains. After a while I looked up again and saw that the mountains appeared smooth! I was thinking, how could this be, when the \\\"smooth\\\" mountain started to sway a little. I smelled a definite skunk cabbage smell. I then realized that this was not the mountain but the silouette of a large animal. I was seeing its head and shoulders as it was standing at the foot of my sleeping bag. I pulled the sleeping bag up over my head. Later I looked out and it was gone. The mountain was back to its normal jagged shape.

It was the first night of the expedition and my brother and I had been asked (as well as two other team members) to go to a location that had a recent sighting reported by [a local law enforcement officer]. The objective for the night was to walk a portion of the mountain road while making occasional wood knocks with hopes of attracting a sasquatch. By the time we arrived at the location and prepared all of our gear it had become completely dark.  We started walking down the mountain road.  After about 5 minutes of walking we heard two short grunting sounds that came from the woods to our left (south of the road).  The grunting noises were very deep sounding, had some power behind them. There were a few moments of silence and blank stares between us. We continued down the road, wondering if the thing would make more noise. We continued doing wood knocks as we walked. A few hours passed as we continued to walk up and down the 3/4 mile stretch of the road, knocking every 20-30 minutes.  Then we were contacted by radio from another team that was positioned approximately 3-5 miles from us along the banks of [a river]. The river team had apparently been hearing wood knocks coming from somewhere between their location and our location. They wanted to check if it was our wood knocks they were hearing. To see whether the river team could hear our wood knocks, we made some loud knocks and asked if the river team could hear us. The river team asked us to repeat the knocks a few times. After a few tries they said they were not able to hear our knocks at all, so whatever they were hearing was closer to them. We continued back up the road.  Not longer after climbing back up the road we heard what I could only describe as a scream that came from the southwest of us, approximately 250 - 300 yards in the woods. The \\\"scream\\\" started as a low, deep moan and went into a very high pitched screech lasting at least a few seconds.  It was very unlike anything we had ever heard. We were shocked because we had hunted in the Pacific Northwest for years and knew every kind of large animal sound. Several minutes of silence went by and we decided to proceed up the road further to where the truck was parked.  After reaching the truck we unloaded some of our equipment. We were ready to start heading back down the road again when we heard the second scream. This time the scream was much closer, within 50 yards of us and on the opposite side of the road from the first scream.  The scream again started as a low moan and reached a very high pitched screech.  The volume and power of the scream was amazing, it made every hair stand on end.  The scream probably lasted a few seconds, but was so loud that I was expecting this animal to come through the trees at any moment. All four stood there in complete shock at what we had just heard.  We eventually gathered ourselves and continued walking up and down the road for a period of time, wondering what was going to happen next. Nothing further happened that evening. My brother and I are experienced outdoorsmen.  We have spent most of our lives in the woods in and around the Pacific Northwest.  We both are very familiar with the calls and sounds of all of the known animal species in the area, especially elk, deer and bear.  The screams we experienced were not any animal that either of us, or any of the others in our team, had ever heard before. If any of us had heard something like this before we sure would not have forgotten it.

Adult Elk and baby Elk tracks were present everywhere and signs were posted about the Elk. There are many game trails that crisscross these hiking trails.

In August 0f 2001, when my wife and I still lived in Florida, we made a trip out to WA and visited the Hoh rainforest.  We hiked up a well-traveled trail--possibly the Spruce Trail--and came upon a footprint of which I still have a picture.  It was a bare human-like footprint about 11-12 inches long.  Given (a) the modest size of the footprint, (b) the popular nature of the trail and (c) the fact that there were many \\\"hippy\\\" types in the area, I assumed it was just a very casual hiker.  But I took a picture anyway, with my boot for comparison. Upon seeing the picture in report #12098, I dug out my picture and was struck by the similarity.  Having lived in WA a few years now and having become better acquainted with what are purported to be genuine sasquatch footprints, I took note of the squared-off toes and the medially-leaning big toe.  In the picture, just above the toe of my right boot, one can see a print I made, which barely sunk in at all compared to the print in question (though moisture levels may have varied). I don't remember much about that day beyond the huge trees.  The rest of that film roll is my wife posing beside big, buttressed trunks.  There were other people on the trail that day, which, to me, made it unlikely that a sasquatch had been hanging out there, though I suppose the print could've been made at night.  Given the traffic on the trail, however, I would've expected it to have been obliterated already.  Perhaps other people were noticing it and stepping around it too.  If I'm not mistaken, there was another less distinct track down (or up) the trail, but I can't be certain.  I've never heard of bigfoot tracks on hiking trails, which was another reason I dismissed the track.  Another possibility is a hoaxer, though you'd think they'd go for something more dramatic and attention-grabbing, like a 16 inch print. The picture was on a normal camera, so I can't put it on the computer.  Please let me know if you'd like me to send it in.

When I walked out the door I untied my Rottweiler/Doberman mix so she could walk with me. She was a very protective dog and I always felt safe with her around. Well she immediately ran under the cabin and refused to come out. Then I heard the crashing through the small alders on my left and it sounded BIG. I immediately ran back into the cabin and got my husband. He ran out the front door and heard the crashing through the trees.

I went down to the shore of the lake to explore while everyone was at camp. When I got there I was surprised to see tons of barefoot tracks everywhere.

I looked up photos of Bigfoot tracks and one of mine looked very similar to the track photographed in the Hoh Rainforest in 2005.

My wife Nan and I live between Newberg and Wilsonville, OR. On February 24, 2016 we decided to take a couple of days off and drive up to the Olympic Peninsula. We drove up to Olympia, WA and took Hwy 101 route along the Hood Canal to through Port Angeles to Forks, where we stayed the night at the Forks Motel. Early on the morning of February 25th (a Thursday) we drove south on Hwy 101 to Upper Hoh Road and east to the Hoh Rain Forest. It was a beautiful clear and dry day, which was unusual for February on the Peninsula. After an enjoyable walk through the Rain Forest we headed back west on Upper Hoh Road. There was very little traffic in either direction and we pretty much had the road to ourselves. Approximately halfway back to Hwy 101, where the road once again comes close to the Hoh River, we had just cleared a corner and were at the beginning of a straight stretch of road which I estimate to be about 1/4-mile long before there was a left-hand corner. At the end of that straight stretch we both saw a very large bipedal creature walk out of the woods on the north side of the road, stride across the road in three strides, and disappear into the woods on the south side of the road. It appeared to be 7-8' tall and covered in dark hair. We both looked at each other in astonishment with that \\\"Did you see what I just saw?\\\" look on our faces. Without making comment of my own I asked Nan to describe what she had just seen, and her description was exactly the same as mine. When we got to that spot where we had seen the creature appear from the woods we stopped and examined the site. The road was in an area that was still within the Olympic National Forest, and the woods were so thick on each side of the road that it was difficult to see more than a few feet into the woods to the north. The trees were just as thick on the south side of the road, but we could tell that we were very close to the Hoh River. There was no trail whatsoever coming out of the woods or going into the woods on the south side of the road. Under the circumstances we could only surmise that we had just seen a Bigfoot that was apparently going across the road to reach the river. Even though I never doubted the existence of Bigfoot, I always considered myself a \\\"Professional Skeptic\\\".

I lived at Scenic about 10 years and enjoyed taking walks by myself with my samoyed dog. That dog would chase bears away, running them up trees. I always felt safe with her around.  One morning, the dog went with my husband to work and I decided to take a walk down to the end of the road towards highway 2. It was a beautiful spring day and the snow still lay in places on the ground.  I can still see and hear this like it was yesterday. I had crossed the small bridge going over the small creek by our place and gotten almost to the end of the road where it meets the highway.  That's when I heard the most god awful sound.  I can still hear it in my mind. The sound was quite close to me. I'm thinking about 1/2 block distance (as the crow flys) and seemed to be coming around the area where the deserted railroad bunkhouses were located across where the depot was located. This animal had huge lungs. The volume was immense. (I'm trying to think of a word for the sound) It started sort of like roar and went to a shrill pitch. Then a pause of about 3 seconds and then the same sound with that shrill pitch, a pause of 3 seconds and another sound. That was it and since I didn't believe in saquatch I wasn't scared of it, ,just curious. I knew all the calls of the animals around our mountains and this wasn't the same. I've tried all these years to figure out what made that noise. I stopped into the forest service office after this happen and asked them if they had ever heard this sound. I was trying to explain it to them as best I could, but they never took me serious. I recieved the same response from my friends that lived in skykomish.  Then after I moved to Spokane some time later I was watching \\\"Unsolved Mysteries\\\". They played sounds that sounded very similar and said to myself \\\"there's the sound or closest to it\\\".  I thought, \\\"no one's going to believe this!\\\" I worked at a hospital in Spokane and one of my indian patients and I got to talking about my experience. She had seen a sasquatch come into her camp as a young girl and chased it away by beating on a drum. She said the most astounding thing she remembered about her experience was the human look in it's eyes. So the native americans have known about them for years. I truly think the sasquatch would be found around that area of Scenic, near Stevens Pass Washington.

There was an old road passable only to bikes, horses and 4 wheel drive that led to power lines and a popular camping/party spot. It was dense forest and no direct sunlight came through the canopy. As my friend and I walked and talked all of a sudden there was a loud growling/screaming and about 50 feet or so in front of us the trees were shaking and what ever it was moved a tree (probably Alder) enough to let sunlight beam down, these were big trees, and it seemed like the earth was shaking a bit. We stopped dead in our tracks just long enough for the adrenaline to kick in and then we ran as fast as we could for the whole half mile out of the woods.

I lived on a piece of property that had 4 houses on about 20 acres. I was 9 at the time and so was my friend.  There were 8 to 9 ponds with a creek connecting them.  They were small ponds average size probably 20 by 30 feet.  There was a field on one side of the upper ponds and a hillside on the other with dense fir trees of various size. It was a fall day probably October and around 4pm and it was kind of dark and cloudy with a medium rain fall.  From the start of one pond to the end of the last pond it was probably 150 to 200 yards. My house was about 100 to 150 yards from the sighting.  My friend and I were catching crawdads in the ponds. We had probably been out there for a couple of hours when it happened. I was close to the ponds on the field side and my friend was behind me about 10 or 15 feet on the field side.  I looked up the hillside 20 feet up and 40 to 50 yards away where I saw a creature 8 feet tall walking upright at a angle going up the hillside.  The hillside was about 125 feet tall. It was big I yelled at my friend, it turned and looked at us.  My friend did not know what I was yelling about.  I started to run towards my house.  I ran right by my friend yelling.  He then saw it and started running behind me. I was terribly scared as was my friend. I only saw it for about 5 or 10 seconds but I know what I saw.  It was big and walking upright.  It looked like the bigfoot from the patterson-gimlin film honestly.  I recall it being black or dark brown with short to medium hair.  I talked to my friend a couple of years ago and we talked about the incident and he agreed with me about what happened.  I had not talked to him for 20 years plus about it.

A group of 75 kids age 7 to 17 and the camp personel.  From a huge pasture area all the campers walked down a trail that was thick with blackberry bushes and was lightly treed with alder, etc.  The trail was about 200 yards long.  At the end of the trail, there was a circular clearing about 150 feet in diameter.  This is where the group set up camp.  There were 3 trails out of the clearing.  The one going to the pasture, one going to the river (over a little rise and about 100 feet away from the clearing) and one trail that deadended 50 feet up.  This is where the campers were to relieve themselves.  A group of 4 twelve year old girls were going to relieve themselves down this trail at about 11pm.  From deep in the berry bushes, we heard something moving.  It sounded like the animal would move a little ways, then stop.  We could hear branches and twigs snapping.  We couldn't figure out what it could be because it was such a thicket of berries.  No human could be in there without getting massively scratched.  We listened for quite awhile and noticed whatever it was was moving closer to us, but it was still a ways away.  Getting scared, we ran back to our sleeping bags.  There was a big circle of girls in their sleeping bags and our group of 5 was off to the side, near the \\\"bathroom\\\" trail.  I listened for a long time from my sleeping bag & noticed the animal was getting closer.  I got up from my friends & moved into the center of the circle of girls!  I fell fast asleep.  One of my best friends did not.  What Jane heard as she lay awake was whatever it was, eventually came out of from the berry bushes.  There were 2 of them.  They communicated by making soft cooing noises to each other that sounded very much like pigeons.  Jane was laying on her stomach in a goosedown sleeping bag with her head on her arms & was petrified.  She could not look up at what was in our camp because she was afraid of what she might see.  She said the two creatures moved all around our camp.  If someone stirred in their sleeping bag, they would stop moving & make no noise.  She could hear them get in our boxes of food.  They continued exploring our camp for hours, intermittantly calling softly to each other.  All the while she is stiff as a board in her sleeping bag.  Then to top it all off, one of them steps on the end of her sleeping bag & she feels the whoosh of the air coming up to her feet.  She moved her feet.  Whatever it was reached down and lightly touched her back!  She - even MORE petrified, just layed there, hoping it wouldn't hurt her or carry her away! I woke at dawn from the center of the big circle of girls & got up to go relieve myself.  Jane was laying in her bag exactly as I described.  She hadn't moved & the down bag was literally soaking wet with her sweat.  I believe she was in mild shock.  She dull-ly told us what happened to her, but she was so wrung out, there was little emotion she showed.  My friends and I walked all over looking for some sign of what she said happened but since the ground was dry, there weren't any distinguishable footprints.  Later when we got back to the Aqua Barn, Jane layed in bed the rest of the day to recover. Our group, to this day, calls this incident \\\"The thing that came to camp!\\\"  Since I was not greatly affected by this, it's fun for me to recall.  Jane and I talked about this incident in 1990 and she IS NOT happy to relate it!

At this time I was behind the wheel of my friends big truck, and was concerned about the snow fall. We were riding along a narrow road with a huge drop-off on one side. My friend told me to keep my foot into it or we may slide off! He said there is always a place to turn around at the top of these roads. After turning around, we proceeded back down. The road went straight with a 90' type turn to the right towards the end of the incline we were coming down. To our left going down was a upward sloping bank or hill (actually the top crest of cascades) and as we turned right, a hill or upward slope on our left.

Fifteen years old at the time, I was staying at my uncle's house near Kent, WA. At the rear of the house is a forested area. Around 7 or 8 am on Dec.25, 1986, we were all leaving to visit other relatives and I realized that I had left something inside the house, so went around to the rear entrance and was fumbling at the lock when I heard a tremendous crashing coming towards me through the forest. The oddest thing about the entire incident was my reactions - completely different to what one would expect. Hearing the crashing coming towards me I didn't (as you would expect someone to do) turn around to see what was happening - I felt a tremendous feeling of dread which certainly didn't help my efforts at unlocking the door. Whatever it was that was coming through the forest was making a LOT of noise and sounded BIG. The noise came closer until it was just approximately 30 metres behind me just inside the woodline and to my left, at which point I very slowly turned around (again it is impossible to convey just how frightened I felt) and I saw a creature standing upright and looking at me. It was tall and bulky but definitely not a  bear standing upright because it didn't have the sloping shoulders of a bear but rather looked like a tall, bulky person in a cheap ape suit. I was genuinely paralyzed with fear and could neither make movement nor sound. The hair or fur was dark brown/black/reddish tints but mostly dark from what I could see. It was, as I mentioned, standing just inside the treeline, so the lower legs were hidden from view - only from about midthigh upwards was visible and definitely looked humanlike but with a pointier head than a normal human. I had the feeling that the exchange of looks lasted quite long but probably only lasted a few seconds before I was finally able to move, at which point I raced back round the front of the house and jumped into the car with the rest of the family, who remarked that I looked like I had seen a ghost. I never told anyone about what I had seen because growing up in the Pacific Northwest, one learns to laugh at the nutcases who claim to have seen bigfoot, and I certainly participated in the ridicule until that day. I only ever went to my uncle's house one other time after that day and sometimes now wish I had been brave enough to have looked in the forest for footprints later but it was simply impossible to have done at the time.\", \"location_details\": \"Hilltop Avenue, dead ending side street going north from E.

I kept on moving up the creek for about 10 minutes? before I heard something moving through the brush on my side of the creek directly in front of me. I couldn't see it at first but it seemed to be coming in my direction. I was scared that I might have walked up on a bear kill or something because whatever it was wasn't backing away or keeping quiet. It was about 50 feet ahead of me when I first saw it. I don't know what it was but it was tall and very muscular, like a linebacker. It had reddish brown fur and huge shoulders. But I don't remember seeing a neck. That's what stands out the most. I remember thinking that somebody must be making a movie or pulling a prank or something up here, but I was in the middle of the woods. I just couldn't accept what I was seeing.

I'd been heading back toward camp for maybe 20 minutes? when I got cold chills all over my body. I hadn't been able to walk away from that smell. It seemed to be moving WITH ME. I had been running like hell down a cut path and it was out there in the underbrush keeping right up with me. I just dropped my day pack and started running the best I could down toward my campsite. I made it back in about 15 more minutes. I was all torn up from the briars and underbrush. I only stopped long enough to get my breath back. I realized that the smell had come all the way down to the campsite. It was as strong as when I first ran into it an hour earlier. I think whatever animal I ran into up there had followed me back. But it didn't show it's face again ( I think it was just trying to scare me off it's territory?) I didn't even pack up my tent, I didn't want to be up there by myself any more.

My task was to deliver the dozer to a logging site.  It was early morning and I'd driven east out of North Bend, WA along the Middle Fork of the Snoqualmie River on SE Middle Fork Road which turns into NFD 5060 Road east of Mt. Si.  I then took a logging road on my way to the drop off site. As I drove down the logging road, up ahead along the side of the road I saw two tall people walking in the direction I was heading.  My first reaction was that they were really tall and must be basketball players.  As I got closer, it looked like they were wearing dark colored full body wetsuits with hoods.  I tried to make sense of what I was seeing and thought maybe they were bow hunters wearing a special suit.  As I drove closer I could see that they both had unusually long arms and that one had a more female shape and stood about 7 feet tall compared to the other which had a male shape and stood about 8 feet tall. The subjects then reacted to my approach by stopping and turning around toward me and stood in the middle of the road in a slightly crouched position.  They seemed agitated and with their feet stationary they turned and looked at both sides of the road by rotated their upper bodies at the waste back and forth, back and forth while swinging their arms at their sides.  When they did this, they looked very ape like. As I closed to about 35-40 yards away, the female jumped and ran off the left side of the road toward the river and disappeared into the brush.  The male stayed in the road a little longer shuffling to the left side of the road.  Finally, as I got even closer, in one step from the edge of the road he jumped a distance of around 20 feet and easily cleared what I now could see was a thicket of thorny blackberry vines at least 8 feet tall, and he was gone. They were both dark brown in color from head to toe.  Their faces were dark brown also.  I didn't really notice if they had fur or hair.  Perhaps the fur or hair was wet and matted down from the rain.  I didn't notice any odor or sounds. I continued to the drop off site 1-2 miles further down the road and began to unload the dozer.  Another driver who was less than a minute or so behind me on the same road arrived.  After unloading and somewhat composing myself, I asked the other driver if he'd seen anything strange along the logging road on his way in.  He said he had not.  I then left the drop off site and stopped at the encounter location.  I looked around but did not find any large tracks in the thin layer of snow along the side of the road.  There was no snow on the dirt/gravel logging road itself.  I didn't want to battle the blackberry vines to follow the creatures' escape route into the forest, so I took off. The only explanation I have for what I saw is that the creatures must have been sasquatches.  Because no human could be that big and jump like that and I know they weren't bears. \", \"location_details\": \"Travel east on SE Middle Fork Road where it turns into NFD 5060 Road then heads east into the Middle Fork Canyon.

This was before all the development was done so we pulled his truck into a clearing (to the left of the main road as you come up on the lake.) We parked and climbed in the bed of the truck.  I would say 15 mins later we heard a rustle in the bushes.  When we turned to look there was a very large animal of some sort.  It was taller then the average black bear and stood like a man.  We litterly sat there froze for a good 2 minutes.  It would turn to the left and walk 3-4 large steps, stop and face our direction.  A few seconds later it would do the same to the right. I would say it was a good 40 yards from us and a good 15 yards from the tree line. It stood 7+ feet tall, long arms, covered in what seemed to be dark hair and walked like a human as it paced.  It was dark and too far away to see its face. Finally my friend slowly grabed my arm and asked me what the hell that was?!  I replied that i had no idea, but it is freaking HUGE!  We both jumped out of the bed of the truck throwing his spare tire on top of our blankets and made a mad dash for the cab. As he drove away I watched out the back window and it just stood there.  To this day i wish he has turned a full circle and shined his lights at it so we could have gotten a better look.

Their report evidensed hearing a very loud scream...etc. Back in August of 1984 I was camping above the Alpental Ski resort at an alpine lake I believe is referred to as Snow Lake (not certain this is the correct name however). It is a fairly exhaustive hike with substantial elevation gain and mileage from the trailhead. I took my brothers black lab for companionship and we found a spot at the lake near the trail. As I was setting up camp that evening I met a young couple that stopped briefly to ask for camp site reccomendations..As I recall we were the only people up there that evening. As night progressed it got dark and fairly cold..I had a camp fire going and could see the other site a few hundred yards down the lakeside. At approximately 10:00 PM that evening I saw my lab sniff the air and get extremely irritated as if another dog were in the area. Within seconds the dog was up and pacing the campsite and acting very nervous (hairs were stanging on his back). At that same time I heard a very loud scream that was high pitched but also changed octives to a low gutteral roar at the end. This sound continued for at least a couple of minutes and then nothing was heard after. I realize that a lake can carry sound fairly well but this noise sounded as if it were literally just outside my camp. The following morning I got up and stirred the fire. Around 6:00 AM the same couple that I met that previous night came up to me to ask if I had heard the sound. I admitted that I heard something I couldnt describe other than a loud scream-roar. The people then described to me that they heard it right outside their campsite. As they described their experience they mentioned that the creature was passing near their site and making the sound.They could actually hear tree branches snapping outside their camp. The couple indicated to me that the 'animal' was pacing around their camp for a few minutes while it was wailing and roaring. These people were most certainly scared by something that evening..as was I.Apparently they had'nt slept the entire night and it looked like it to me. They appeared emotionally and physically exhausted to me. They never gave their name but they made the effort to come to me and inform that they were leaving immediately and I would be 'solo' up on the lake. I realize that there are several animals in the northwest that make various noises..mountain lions for example. This noise was nothing like I've ever heard. I have sampled the audio recordings you have on your site but they dont compare to what I heard. The screams are very similar but there was most certainly a change of octive as I described to a low roar. If instinct tells me anything this was a territorial 'notice' or noise...needless to say I left not long after the couple and havent returned since. I would actually like to exchange any information on audio experiences similar to mine for that area. Feel free to post this if you deem it appropriate.

All of us had the hair on the backs of our necks (and everywhere else) standing straight up because of the frightening sounds we were hearing.  This kept up for quite a while until we all decided we'd sleep better if we went indoors.  I think if we had thought it was a Bigfoot, we would have run inside the house immediately.

I'm no expert, but I don't think anyone in their right mind would want to wake up all the neighbors by butchering their hogs after midnight.  Besides, it didn't sound like anything we had ever heard before.  We all thought--if ever you were going to make a movie about ghosts wailing--this would be the perfect sound! On 2 other occasions within a few weeks of this first incident, my husband heard the same loud moaning through the woods at night. Years later one of my step daughters and I had watched a TV program called Northwest Afternoon.  That day they had played a Bigfoot moaning and it sounded just like what we heard!

I've given these whistling sounds alot of thought, as two of the three sounded entirely not like any bird I've ever heard - more like a person would whistle, really, only pretty loud, but flat and smooth. The third sounded more like a bird, but the last of its three notes would reverberate all over itself - a piercing note that echoed fairly intensely after termination. (Maybe two weeks earlier, I heard the same sound in the Upper Cle Elum River valley, up on a slope going east away from Tucquala Meadows, coming from several individuals, which I assumed were some kind of bird I'd never heard before.  But, then again, I've heard WHOOPING in the same approximate location before, only to write those off, too, as some kind of bird I've never heard before.)  The first two, flat-toned, human-like whistles (but with more \\\"air\\\" behind them - far \\\"richer\\\") were to my northeast and east.  The northeast whistle was noticeably stronger and sounded like it was getting closer.  The east whistle sounded like it moved a little closer and towards the road (south), when the third whistle began.  For about maybe 15 seconds it sounded like they were going back and forth.  Then it just stopped, and all went absolutely quiet again, save for a ground-branch snap to the east immediately after it ended. I tried to ignore the nature of the whistles as best as I could but an occasional branch being crunched on the ground kept me on edge for about the next hour.  I didn't feel alone, but didn't feel threatened either.  I even slept in the back of my truck, under the trees. The whistling described in report #1674 spurned me to share this.  Because \\\"trying to sound like birds\\\" crossed my mind while hearing the first two whistlings, and I've heard none of these \\\"bird sounds\\\" before. What gets me is that on the Upper Cle Elum I was whistling back and forth with a single because I thought the way it ended was extremely impressive (piercing).  I was fascinated by how far and fast the end-note was pushed through the air by its maker.  Then a couple more joined in, with one sounding to be a good couple-hundred yards in the woods, and a couple hundred feet up the slope, but it was still plenty loud. Hell, maybe they were birds, and maybe the last one to join in at Tinkham was a bird, too, but the other two in no way sounded like a bird, hawk, eagle, owl or anything.  This leads me to believe these all weren't bird sounds. In fact, I had no inclination to try whistling back at Tinkham whatsoever.

I need to know if this is evidence of proximity to the Sasquatch. I live just outside the old Weyerhauser Tree Farm in Snoqualmie Valley and spend alot of time taking early morning walks there with my dog to take pictures. One morning I had hiked in about 1.5 miles off a logging road to a swamp that was partially exposed by logging and was sitting for about 20 minutes on the ground up from the edge of the swamp in the bushes waiting for the frogs to start up again when on the hillside across the swamp from me I first heard thumping. It was rapid short duration and deep. There was no more than 5 or 6 knocks. The sound was much deeper than the sounds made by woodpeckers, I have heard and seen these too while out there walking. The tree thumps are very rapid, I couldn\\u2019t knock that fast one handed at all with something heavy enough to make that sound. The sound is also much fuller bodied than knocking a dead branch against a tree branch; the sound is more like if 4 people were to hit a hollow trunk in fairly quick succession 1 1/2 to 2 times. This first thumping was followed shortly by a second simular series of resonant thumps about 250 yrds from the first on the same side of the hill. This thumping was closely followed by 2 short calls coming from each original thumping source areas repectively on the hillside. The calls were one constant sound for a short duration, one call and then from the other location exactly the same sound. They sounded like a howler monkey in hollowness and pitch. There used to be howler monkeys just in the entrance of the San Diego Zoo of which I used to have a yearly membership. Like the thumping it was a sound that traveled far. The other location where I heard the thumping was right outside the Chester Morse watershed which is off limits. I was again out hiking in the early morning with my dog for picture taking. No vocalizations this time, just the same rapid patting of a tree trunk. I can't stress enough that this isn't woodpeckers, I do know that sound.

Hello, I am now 48, and my dad was a telegrapher during the 1960's at the former depot at Scenic.  I used to greatly enjoy spending a week at a time at Scenic with him while he was on duty, staying in his trailer near the depot, and it was a wonderful place for a young railroad enthusiast to grow up.  In later years I started an annual tradition of camping at Scenic and spending several days picking huckleberries on Tonga Ridge. On August 24, I had finished picking berries for the day and had returned to Scenic to a little, mostly forgotten camping spot just inside the edge of a dark old-growth forest.  The southern hillside becomes somewhat steep a short distance away.  It was dusk, I was setting up to cook some dinner, and had my Coleman light burning.  A few minutes before this, two or more men in two BNSF vehicles had parked next to the tracks waiting for an eastbound freight to arrive which was having engine trouble coming up the hill (knew this from my scanner).  I could hear them talking in their vehicles.  Suddenly, from what seemed to come from up above the hillside, there was a bizarre two-second-long very loud ascending-frequency swooping cry.  I have perfect pitch so I can tell you it started around 500 Hz and went up to about 800 Hz.  This was followed by  three or four bizarre shrieks of some sort, a little higher, which almost sounded like some kind of goofy laughter, but... I had not read anything seriously about Sasquatch for many years, and had not then ever heard a recording of one, so these sounds did not make any sense.

But there were no other vehicles that I knew of, and there was no reason for anyone to BE up there on that hillside above a forgotten campground.  The intensity of the calls did not make sense, either.  I doubt if a human could have made a call that loud. I went about my business, but as I sat there eating dinner with the light burning I had this very odd feeling that something was watching me.  (I know how silly this all sounds.)  I slept in the car as planned (doors locked).  Next night, camped near the Cascade Tunnel west portal.  On the night of the 26th, camped at the first location again.  Heard nothing, but had that same creepy feeling that something up above was watching everything.  I thought about walking up that hillside to a familiar old waterfall on Surprise Creek, but something told me, \\\"Not this time.\\\" As a Christian, I do believe in angelic protection, but after reading dozens of encounter stories in the last couple days, and reading Judy Walter's story from 1970 just tonight, and hearing the audio clips, I don't feel at ease about camping there anymore, unless I do it at the other side of the tracks under the night lights! The difference between what I heard and most of the audio files I have heard: the latter have sounded mostly like ghastly shrieks out of some horror movie.  This was more of a pure tone at first, then the following sounds had other frequencies mixed in.  A very intense sound. I have a question about animal scat.  While picking berries on Tonga Ridge on the 27th, I walked about a thousand feet northwest of the road where people never go, through the trees and brush, looking for a better berry spot, and saw a pile of what I thought was bear scat in an open place.  Now I'm not so sure that's what it was.  It looked similar to human, but about two inches diameter; broken in many segments; well defined, as though not having a high moisture content when deposited, and was black & grey with much fiber content; probably several days old.  I note this because you have another story in this collection about someone seeing the creature on a Foss River forest road, which is the one I go up to get to Tonga Ridge, on F.S. 6830. I'm also wondering now if those skunky smells I encounter now and then while driving across the mountains late at night are always skunk.  ???\", \"location_details\": \"Forested campsite  Scenic, WA.\", \"county\": \"King County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 12510: Vocalizations near Scenic interrupt a camper\\u2019s quiet evening\", \"latitude\": 47.71167, \"longitude\": -121.1544, \"date\": \"2005-09-12\", \"number\": 12510.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c23z7jdh9g\", \"temperature_high\": 61.24, \"temperature_mid\": 52.2, \"temperature_low\": 43.16, \"dew_point\": 45.75, \"humidity\": 0.82, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.3, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 325.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.5, \"location\": \"POINT(-121.1544 47.71167)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was lying in bed, trying to go to sleep, when I heard an unusual sound from outside through my partly-opened window.  It sounded like a cross between a person moaning, a dog howling, and a cat growling (the timbre was human-like and in human vocal range, it was a high-to-low pitch sound like a howl, and there was a hint of growliness underneath that sounded like an angry cat, but much larger).  It sounded almost like someone moaning \\\"booooooo\\\".  The \\\"b\\\" sound was faint, but definitely present.  Each vocalization was about 5-6 seconds in length, with about 5 seconds between each.  It didn't seem very loud, but it also was not faint. I listened for several seconds, then got out of bed to peek out the window.  My front yard is well-lit by a streetlight, but I didn't see anything.  I have very bad eyesight, though, so after looking and listening for a minute and seeing nothing obvious, I went to get my glasses.  I noticed my cat was staring at the window very intently, not moving.  Normally when he hears a noise outside he will ignore it, glance over casually, or watch intently with his tail switching.  He didn't move a muscle. I looked out the window, through the blinds, with my glasses on but still saw nothing.  Being very familiar with the noises of dogs, cats, and coyotes (howling, fighting, mating, growling, etc.), I was spooked when I could not place the sound.  The next day I also looked up sounds for different types of owls, bears, and large cats--no matches. I went to my parents' bedroom to wake up my mom.  My bedroom is at the front of the house, and theirs is at the back (both on the 2nd floor).  I was shocked to hear the noise just as clearly from their room, echoing around the neighborhood.  From my room it just didn't seem that loud.  This makes me wonder if whatever was making the noise was really at the front of the house, or if it was elsewhere in the neighborhood and the sound carried. By the time I awakened my mom I had been hearing the sound for about 4-5 minutes, at fairly regular intervals of no more than 10 seconds.  When she got up I told her to listen to the noise and asked her to come to my room (since I still thought the creature might be visible from my window).  She went to the window and quickly pulled up the blinds and opened the window (which made quite a bit of racket).  We saw nothing, and the noise immediately stopped.  I never heard it again that night, or any night after. It was somewhat simliar to the Mississippi recording.  If my neighborhood were in a more sparsely populated area, I would probably be much more certain of the possibility that it was a sasquatch.\", \"location_details\": \"Neighborhood is near Marymoor Park (640 acre county park), which is linked by sparsely populated, wooded areas to the Cascade foothills about 10 miles away.\", \"county\": \"King County\", \"state\": \"Washington\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 17847: Possible late night vocalizations heard outside Redmond\", \"latitude\": 47.6597, \"longitude\": -122.105, \"date\": \"2005-10-12\", \"number\": 17847.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"c23pjkjvgk\", \"temperature_high\": 57.53, \"temperature_mid\": 54.685, \"temperature_low\": 51.84, \"dew_point\": 47.54, \"humidity\": 0.79, \"cloud_cover\": 0.74, \"moon_phase\": 0.33, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0019, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1019.24, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 160.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.08, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.105 47.6597)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was walking my dogs in Marymoor Park, near Redmond, WA.  It was in the early-to mid-afternoon. The park was predominantly empty and quiet, and despite recent rain, the paths were not overly muddy.  It was a sort of hazy day, with some sun, probably 50-60 degrees. We had followed a somewhat under-utilized trail/road that parallels Hwy 520, going from the velodrome down to the Sammamish River.  It is a grassy area with occasional brush.  The trail makes a T-junction at the Sammamish River bank.  One can turn right and go under Hwy 520 to Redmond Town Center shopping district, or turn left and remain in Marymoor Park. Just at the bank of the Sammamish River, there is a stand of brambles that create large mounds on both sides of the trail on the Marymoor side of Hwy 520.  This little bramble forest is probably about 30 yards long.   The Sammamish River travels along the west edge of the park, emptying into Lake Sammamish about 1/4 mile away (or slightly more?), in the park.  (Salmon run this river in October/November.) We turned left and were walking through the brambles, parallel to the Sammamish River, heading into the park and away from Hwy 520. Just as we were at the end of the bramble mounds, and emerging into a clearing area, to my right, from the river bank, there arose a hair-raising screeching howly yowling sound, like something terrified and screaming. It did not sound human and was quite long-winded/sustained. I stopped and stood very still.  I was chilled to the bone by the sound, the hair standing up on my body.  One dog looked towards the river, his fur also standing on end and the other cowered a bit, her tail down. The sound was coming from within about 50 yards of us, but I could not see anything or anyone along the river bank.  There is brush and trees there, so they were blocking my view of some areas of the river bank. The W. Sammamish Parkway is across the river and parallel to the river and the trail I was on.  The cars travelling along that road create a certain roar as do the ones on Hwy 520.  Whatever this yowling sound was, it was super audible above the sound of traffic on both these busy roads. After a minute, we began walking again, and the sound arose again.  This time, it was further away, maybe 75 yards up the river.  This time, the yowling sound was followed by knocking sounds of wood on wood.  At this point, I did go to the edge of the river and look up the river bank to see if I could catch a glimpse of whoever or whatever was making the noise, but I could not see anyone or anything there.  I wondered if it was people goofing around, but I did not see anyone or hear people sounds. A few minutes later, I heard knocking, again, but no yowling.  It was probably from the area just below an old non-functioning windmill that stands on the banks of the Sammamish River, near the west entrance & bridge into the park. When we reached the main bridge that comes into the park from the Sammamish Parkway (close to the windmill), we turned east, towards the Clise Mansion and park facilities area, and were no longer walking along the river.  I did not hear any other yowling sounds after that.  Also, from that vantage point (the bridge), I could not see anyone or anything along the river. About 15 minutes later, when I drove out of the park, I again stopped near the bridge to look up and down the river, but saw nothing and no one.\", \"location_details\": \"Marymoor Park is a fairly large park that used to be a farm.

Second day I set out for day hike and exploration and things got weird.I head over to other side of the lake along a sheer wall that rises about 1000 feet up to summit straight up almost jumping large rock screes and swinging with the aid of blueberry bushes 40 feet above lake i reach the other side  to a level area and begin planned day hike .

I was able to make out toes on the print but I was unable to determine any other features since the print looks a few weeks old but still got a picture (which I still have). So we continued on. We found a road that was washed out so we went on foot about 2 miles in. We first went about half a mile in when all of a sudden a rock was thrown over our heads and landed in front of me. We thought it was very strange and a little creepy. We had some guns which in a way comforted us that we had some sort of protection. So we decided to keep moving.

There was nothing around the truck that could've hit it except for a nearby stick. My friend threw the stick back in the woods and we all got back in the truck. It was about 5 minutes later in the same location when something hit the truck again. Like before we turned the light on and got out. We looked around for the object and it turned out to be the exact same stick. This is when things got weird because he threw the stick back in the woods and got back inside. Then it happened again and as we're outside, we threw the same stick back and we were still looking around as we continued to hear movement.

We continued to walk and stop with lights off until we got about a half mile from the camp.  At this point Atticus, the 5 year old, was ready to go back.  We started back and then stopped to do some whoops.  I did two whoops spaced about 30 seconds apart, no returned noises.  We continued to walk and stop.  When we were halfway back we let Atticus try some whoops.  He did two about 30 seconds apart.  After his second whoop there was an immediate response from within a hundred yards of us.  It was a slightly higher pitch whoop than I have heard before.  We waited about 4 minutes before continuing to go back to camp.  When we were about 100 yards from camp we stopped.  Jennie and Nick remained with lights off as Atticus and I turned our flashlights on and returned to camp.

As we sat and debriefed in camp we heard noises around camp, but dismissed them as raccoons.  I was looking to the woods beyond camp and began to see orange eye shine.  I thought it was a single star, but it moved lightly and would leave and return into view.  The next morning I saw that where I was seeing the glow was well below the ridge line and could not have been a star. Nick and I traded places while sitting in camp and he saw the same shine leave and return a few times as well.  Nick and I returned to near where he and Jennie had sat to leave an apple in a tree.

We listened for a while, heard nothing, and went back to bed.  In the morning Jennie told us what happened to them in the camper.  At 1:35 am she was woke up not by the raccoon on the picnic table, but by something large walking in the woods behind camp.  She heard us scare away the raccoon and whatever was in the woods walked off.  At 3:10 am something started to shake the camper.  She said the camper was moved back and forth 3 times.  Her reaction was to laugh out loud from inside the camper.  She laughed because Sara and Hagen were sleeping through the event.  The shaking stopped and she heard something retreat back into the woods.\", \"location_details\": \"South Campground of Interstate State Park\", \"county\": \"Polk County\", \"state\": \"Wisconsin\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 45418: Campers hear possible vocalization and have trailer shaken at Interstate State Park\", \"latitude\": 45.38867, \"longitude\": -92.66538, \"date\": \"2014-06-13\", \"number\": 45418.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"cbn45qg0hj\", \"temperature_high\": 74.17, \"temperature_mid\": 67.025, \"temperature_low\": 59.88, \"dew_point\": 46.37, \"humidity\": 0.63, \"cloud_cover\": 0.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.52, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 240.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.14, \"location\": \"POINT(-92.66538 45.38867)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I work up to 2 a.m. in the morning.

As he got within approximately 35 ft. of it, he saw this creature step down into a ditch on the side of the road. When he was almost  up to it, approximately 200 to 300 yds. away, he said it was carrying something that looked like a goat or a sheep. When he got up to where it was, he slowed down to get a better look, and it turned and looked right at him. Mr. Hughes said that it was covered with fur, even the face area, except for two darker spots that were where the eyes would have been. It had large, honey colored patches of fur all over it. This area is aproximately 9 miles N.E. of the city of Neillsville and mostly farm land with some wooded areas. Mr. Hughes got out of there as fast as he could and did not report this to the Clark County Sheriffs Dept. until the next day for fear that people would say he was crazy. The Sheriffs Dept. sent a Deputy to check the area out but he did not find any footprints or other evidence. Mr. Hughes said that there  is a very large hayfield where he saw this creature and that the ground is very hard sod which would not show footprints.

We decided to take our camper up to the land and stay overnite with our 3 children.  At aprox 2:00am I woke up because I heard something walking around the camper.  We are in a remote area in the woods near a gravel road.  The footsteps were right next to the camper.  I was very still but knew that my husband was also awake.  I whispered to him \\\"do you hear that?\\\" He replied that he did and it woke him also.  He had hoped that It would not wake me.  We were very still for a few minutes listening to the steps.  This was a creature that was walking on two feet.  We could hear the crunching of leaves and twigs under it's feet.  We decided to make some noise and see if we could scare whatever it was away. I flipped on the camper lights and we yelled for whoever it was to make themselves known as we were armed.  Nothing replied but the foot steps stopped.  We waited about 5 muinutes and turned the lights off again and waited. About 10 minutes after that the foot steps started again.  My husband went outside with his flashlight and weapon to take a look.  Keep in mind it is a really dark night and we are set in the woods away from anyone who might be able to hear us if we needed help.  Again, nothing.  He came back in and we settled down again, 10 minutes later the steps started again.  I know that this is something on two feet that is not afraid of us but is not human.  We decided to get out of there with our boys.  My husband stood outside while I carried them into our mini van and we left.  We spent the night in the parking lot of Kwik Trip in Black River Falls.  In the morning we went back to break the camper down and look around for traces of anything unusual.  Because of the heavy leaf and pine needles covering the ground we were unable to find any footprints.  We looked at the camper and tried to determine if something was rubbing on it to make the sound.  There was nothing there. As we were taking the camper down I felt really creepy, like we were being watched.  My father in law several years earlier told my husband that he saw a big foot crossing Fischer Rd on his way back to camp.  He told my son that he thought he saw one in the woods while deer huntiong also.  My husband while hunting when he was younger found several deer carcases in the woods all piled on topp of each other.  At the time they dismissed it as someone hitting them with a vehicle and dragging them into the woods.  Now when he looks back at it he thinks they were way too far into the woods for someone to drag in from the road. The carcases were picked clean. While we never saw anything I really truly believe we had a bigfoot encounter.   I know that the creature walked on two feet and had a long stride.   It came back over and over again.  I wish we would have had a stronger flashlight, we only had a mag light on us.  Now we have a really high power flashlight in the event we need to look far into the woods. I have been back to the spot several times and my husband and his family hunt every year in that same spot.  As far as we know nobody else has had the same experince.  I will never go back and camp  there again.  If they are as big as people say they are they are it could have easily pulled my kids out of that camper through the canvas. My husband and I have jobs that require us to be honest and not embelish experinces.

I worked 58 hours a week so I had little time to do anything else besides work.  I had purchased a tent and decided to go camping one Saturday night (it was in August as best I can remember).  Because of the hours I worked, this was the only night I could go camping (I also went to church on Sundays but I had plenty of time to get up and make it to church \\u2013 service did not start until 10:00 AM). After arriving home from work on the Saturday (date not known exactly) I planned to go camping on, I packed my backpack with all the necessary items for the short stay including my new tent.  I left the house and hiked the mile or so to the area where I planned to camp.  Also, my dog accompanied me.  He was a fairly large collie dog weighing about 80 pounds.  This dog was very intelligent and to my knowledge was not afraid of any animal (this is an important fact to this incident).  I had never seen him back down from a fight. The area was forest (a mix of pine and eastern hardwoods) and consisted of 1,050 acres.  I knew this area well because I had hunted it for approximately 4 years.  I also hunted a farm directly adjacent to this property which consisted of 450 acres.  This area is surrounded by old farmland as well as other stretches of forested land.  I made camp on top of a ridge that was relatively flat for the area. After setting up my tent and camp, I made a fire pit (It was the dry months and I did not want to start a forest fire) and started a small fire to cook on. At approximately 9:30 PM I turned in for the night.  At around 10:00 PM I was awakened by an \\u201canimal\\u201d call I had never heard before.  I can only describe the sound by saying it was big and had the lung capacity of a lion or an elephant.  It literally shook the forest and my chest. I have pretty much heard everything there is to hear in the eastern forests (life long hunter and geologist \\u2013 I have literally spent years in the woods) and this was so completely different there was nothing at the time I could compare it to (recently, I heard the male gorilla recording that was posted on the BFRO web site and it sounded eerily similar). At first I was unsure of what I heard because I was half asleep.  The first time I heard the call it came from about 20 yards off to my left.  15 seconds later I heard the same thing directly behind my tent still about 20 yards off.  By this time I am setting up putting on my pants and boots.  Again, about 15 seconds later, I heard the same call off to the right of my tent about 20 yards off.  My hair was literally standing on end.  At this point, I was somewhat concerned that I was not hearing my dog bark or growl.  He was sleeping outside the tent and appeared to have left.  I grab an eight inch hunting knife and a wimpy flashlight I had with me.  When I pulled the tent flap back to shine the flashlight on whatever was making the noise, I noticed my dog backing up with his tail between his legs, the hair on the nape of his neck sticking straight up growling just barely audible. He could see what was making the noise but I was unable to make out any thing besides trees with the flashlight I had.  Whatever was out there, the dog kept his eyes on it.  I believed to this day that dog would have protected me to the death.  As I have already stated the hair on my body was standing on end and I was extremely afraid (I am 6\\u2019 1\\u201d,  220 lbs and don\\u2019t scare too easily).  I believe whatever was making the sound was doing so in a threatening manner. I left all my gear and only took the knife and flashlight for protection as I hiked the mile back out of the woods.  My dog constantly looked back.  He walked beside me the whole way out and would not leave my side.  I had to cross a couple of fields and I never saw anything following us but there were also stands of trees that ran beside the fields in the direction my dog was looking. After church the next day, I went back and got all my gear and it was exactly like I had left it.  There was also food that was left untouched.  I scouted the area for tracks but found none.

They took their 4 wheeler back to the second field that is just behind the one it has been seen in.  The waited for it to walk in.  After some time of sitting they started to smell a horrible stench. My brother stood up to look in the woods behind them and he saw the creature squatting down behind a tree.  My brother then moved to get a better look at it when it stood up and left.  He then went to look for it and saw it foot imprint on some leaves on the ground, he said they weren't very good but he could see that its foot prints where about 5 feet apart. My older brother, his wife and 6 year old son were riding on their 4 wheeler back in old 93 hollow.  It was between 7:00pm - 8:00pm when they saw what they thought to be a black bear walking on its hind legs.  They stopped the 4 wheeler and turned off the engine to watch it. When they did this the creature also stopped and was watching them.  My brother and His wife saw the creature and they looked at each other over a distance of around 200 feet for about 2 minutes.  My sister-in-law described it to me this way.  When it turned to face us, I could see through its legs.  Its legs were not touching together.  Its arms hung down its side just above its knees, and its shoulder and mid drift were real broad.  It had fur from head to toe. Two minutes later the creature took off into a stride across the field with its arms swinging at its side and a slight bend to its form.   At the end of the field it turned and went into the woods.  At that distance they could see it as it walked through the woods.  They figured it to be about 8 - 9 feet tall.  They said it could not have been a bear walking on its hind legs covering the distance it covered in the short time it covered it.   They watched it enter into the woods and then went home.  When they got home their son, scared from what he had just seen, started crying.  He swore to his mom he was never going to ride his bike or motor bike in that hollow ever again. The next day my brother took my younger brother and my uncle back in the hollow with him to see if they could find any tracks this creature had made.  They searched but did not find any, it was over grass and it rained most of the night.  So my older brother gave up and went home leaving my younger brother and my uncle in the hollow.  Shortly after my younger brother and uncle saw the creature.  They were in the same location as my other brother was the night before.  They watched it come out of the wooded area about 400 yards below them and cross the road.  It went down the a hill into a valley where they couldn't see it.  Then suddenly it came up on the other side of the hill and walked along side the edge of the field and entered the wooded area where it did (or another) the night before.  My brother got to see it through his binocular and said it looked like a pro basket ball player but much more muscular with fur from head to toe.  He said all he could see was its back side and it wasn't anything he had ever seen before.  My brother also said he yelled at it but it didn't faze the creature at all. Two days later, in the morning my older brother and his wife went to the same area to go mushroom hunting.  They were in the power lines when they heard a loud knocking on one side in the woods, like someone hitting something on a tree.  Across on the other side, where one old dilapidated house was, they heard something screaming.  My brother described it as a high pitch hunting dog scream.  They said this went on continuously.  My brother started to walk down toward the house to see what it was.  The closer he got the more it spooked him, so he went back and got on his 4 wheeler leaving his wife on top of the power lines.  His wife said when he started up his 4 wheeler and headed down the road toward the house the knocking got louder and the screaming got louder and more intense.  She said the one that was in the woods knocking started crashing through the woods in the direction that she was in, then stopped when it heard the 4 wheeler turning back.  My brother, who turned around because the screaming was so loud he heard it over his loud 4 wheeler, then got his wife and left the area shaken up a little.  They didn't think the creature would be there in the morning, they thought they slept during the day or something.

Stein during a phone interview with Bob Jackson in 2003. Recently, Jackson gave permission to submit his account to the BFRO.  Jackson, also known as \\\"Action Jackson,\\\" was legendary among park supporters - notorious among outfitters and scofflaws - for his enforcement of park rules and regulations. He retired as a Yellowstone ranger in 2004. Few people have ever known Yellowstone's backcountry and its wildlife like Jackson. \\\"The  first time heard anything was in the mid-late 70s. An outfitter and I were riding up Fan Creek in the northwest section of the park. Up the drainage in Stellaria Creek, we heard a sound that just kept going and going. It was probably a mile away. It filled the whole valley up - kind of 1,000 like elk going to their death. I couldn\\u2019t believe this thing had that much volume for that long  a period of time. He had never heard anything like it, neither. \\\"A couple of weeks later, I was coming out from Sportsman Creek, taking a trail which comes out of Fan Creek. I was 11 miles back in, up high in a subalpine fir meadow complex. I was on a  steep sidehill with horses and in woods but down below about 40-50 yards there was a kind of fairly flat meadow, with dense  subalpine thickets. There were these low fir growths that have a centerpiece tree and then everything kind of cone-shapes to ground. They were about 20 yards wide or so. \\\"The horses were flaring their noses and snorting, like they do when a grizzly bear is real close, but I could see fairly good all around and I couldn\\u2019t see one. So I started looking down below me, and the horses were really agitated \\u2013 they\\u2019re wanting to get out of there. I held them but only with effort. \\\"I looked down to see where griz was, and I saw a deer at edge of thicket. All at once it bolted and started jarring ahead perpendicular to me. Right then coming out the other side was this thing that was running on two feet. It was black like a bear and it had long arms and ran. I think I held it there 30 seconds, but it got scared and then came out. It ran but not super fast. It ran to another thicket and went at angle out of thicket to another thicket about 40-50 yards away (At this point, the creature was 75 yards downslope.) \\\"It kept hitting these thickets trying to get away from me. I\\u2019ve never seen a bear do that. They\\u2019ll always take a straight line. \\\"The first thing I thought was \\u201cbear\\u201d but right away I realized this black shaggy thing wasn\\u2019t a bear. This thing was smart. I\\u2019ve never seen animal trying to pick up protection as it fled. \\\"I tied that together with sound had on other side of the drainage. \\\"It wasn\\u2019t that tall \\u2013 it looked like it was like 6 foot, maybe 6' 5\\\". The side of the face looked like it had a lot of fur. Most of the time it was angling away, so I only got a good look at the head for probably the first 10 steps. \\\"The proportions of the torso - it looked more stocky than anything else. I notived the arms swung more than a human\\u2019s would and it didn\\u2019t have elbows cocked. \\\"This was no hoax.

Location: Mayslick, Kentucky (Mason County) Investigators: Ron Schaffner and Earl Jones -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Case Data: C.F. and his family were watching television when they heard a loud noise on the front porch. C.F. said he heard his son's pet rooster disturbed. When he peered out the front door, he saw a white, hairy creature with pink eyes that must have weighed about 400 pounds and was about 7 feet tall. The creature was holding the rooster by the neck and then threw it against the side of the house. It then proceeded around the back of the house in a vacant lot. C.F. claimed to have grabbed his .22 pistol and followed the intruder. He fired on the creature twice, as it ran out of sight. Our investigation began shortly after hearing of the incident through a small article in the Cincinnati Enquirer. We contacted a Maysville, Kentucky newspaper, who in turn told us of a local radio newsman doing his own work into the matter. Doug McGill of WFTM, Maysville was kind enough to give us C.F.'s phone number. We called him and arranged an interview on Sunday, October 12. C.F.  believes that the lights coming from his porch and living room may have frightened the creature and that is why it seemed to go on a rampage. C.F.  said that its white hair was real long - much like a horse's mane. He also stated that the creature was \\\"man-like\\\", except that those eyes were like that of an animal. C.F. described other interesting facts. He described the creature's gait as having large strides, but it appeared as moving at a slow speed, as if he (C.F.) could catch up with it. but the faster C.F.ran at it, the further distance between them. He said it almost like a dream - the kind of dream that when a wild animal is chasing you and you cannot seem to run away. There was a clothes line that stretches from a tree to the back porch. He did not know why the creature evaded the line, but he remembers that he almost hung himself because it was so dark. Conclusions: Close scrutiny of the family pet rooster revealed no signs of physical harm or injuries. It would be difficult to believe that this animal could withstand the force of being projected against the house by a creature of the reported size. C.F.  also told us that another pet - a raccoon was found on the roof later that night and no one knew how it got there. It had been in a closed cage earlier that day. The clothes line may have been a depth perception, or night blindness on C.F.'s part. He probably just forgot about it being there. We spent several hours backpacking the surrounding area and could not find any trace evidence, such as footprints, droppings, or hair. There wasn't any recent rain, so the terrain was quite hard. The last instant the creature was observed, it was headed up the gravel road that lies to the west of C.F.'s house. Other members of the family told us about a car with some teenagers that may have seen it. They told us that when their father chased the unknown around the house, this car stopped for a few seconds and then spun away at a high rate of speed, leaving tire marks a good distance up the road. These marks were still visible on our visit. Attempts to track down this car were fruitless. While there is no physical evidence, we are still left with the testimony of Mr. C.F. . His credibility - in our opinion- lends credence to the story. It should be remembered that it was the press - not him that began using the term bigfoot. We can neither prove, nor disprove his story; therefore the case is still listed as an unknown.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Mason County\", \"state\": \"Kentucky\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 2425: Family has evening sighting in Mayslick\", \"latitude\": 38.51465, \"longitude\": -83.83695, \"date\": \"1980-10-07\", \"number\": 2425.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dnu7h5ru17\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-83.83695 38.51465)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Subject: Tall, white haired \\\"ape-like\\\" creature Date: November 5, 1980 @ 4:00 or 5:00 AM Witness: N.

My brother, a friend of mine, and I were sleeping out in our \\\"tent\\\" made of plastic tossed over one of those umbrella type clothes lines. The plan was to sneak out later to walk up town to meet with our girlfriends. It was probably about 2 a.m. when I came out of the tent.  Our house was built into a hillside and over looked the college owned cornfield and out across the county which at that time was not very developed. I was standing with my back to the field looking up the hill at the stars while waiting for the others to get up. I got impatient and had turned around toward the tent to tell them to hurry when I saw what I first thought was my neighbor standing at the corner of the house next to the pine tree that grew there. Problem was this thing looked to be about 7 or 8 feet tall, as it's head was into the branches. My mind was racing trying to grasp/rationalize what I was seeing. Why was my neighbor wearing white? How did he know we were out here tonight?  Why was he standing so still and how the hell did he get so tall?  We, meaning \\\"it\\\" and I, stared at each other for several seconds.  Then the thing turned and pushed off against the tree and bolted down over the bank and into the woods toward the corn field.  I was impressed with the speed, the lack of noise it made while running and the fact that the tree,which was pretty big,actually swayed when it pushed off from it.  About that time my friend came out of the tent and I told him about what I had just saw. I don't remember if he acted like he believed me or not. My brother was more inclined to believe my story because he and my sister had often heard what we called \\\"the cruncher\\\" while sleeping out on the screened in backporch (which is about 15 feet off the ground on the back of the house). You see,  back before we had air conditioning we three kids would sleep on the porch during the summer to get the cooler night air. We had a small mutt dog that would sleep with us. Many times we would be waked up the sound of our young imaginations sounded like an animal munching on animal bones. We were scared too death but would look over the edge trying to see what ever it was. We never did see anything because the woods were so thick and we were so far up. We knew we weren't crazy because the dog would sit there stock still and give one of those low throaty growls that would make a person freeze if you heard it in the dark. We tried a couple times to get the dog to go outside and (we were hoping) chase the thing.  We never saw a dog resist so hard. She acted like we were trying to shove her into a fire or something.  After that dog died we got another that reacted the very same way and was only about half as smart as the little mut dog. Anyway, my dad had flood lights installed which only succeeded in lighting up the wall of trees and vegetation. Back to the sighting,  I can't recall a lot of detail, I've often wanted to try being hypnotised to see if I could recall more. What I remember is the thing was covered with off white to tan colored hair with less on it's face and stomach area. I don't recall facial details at all which frustrates and frightens me at the same time. I also don't recall any smell which is not unusual.  I seem to have inherited my mothers' poor sense of smell. The arms were longer than a humans and the strength was demonstrated when it shoved the tree. This is the only experience in my life that I can not explain rationally. My brother and sister can verify \\\"the cruncher\\\". We also built a playhousein the back yard which we only slept in one time and that was on Halloween with several other kids! We once went into the corn field and picked so much corn that we had to leave it piled up in the thicket with the idea to get the rest the next day.  Problem was the next morning it was gone, every last ear. Way too much for a raccoon or even a family of racoons to have hauled off. I should add that this was what we called \\\"field corn\\\" which became rock hard when ripe and was used to feed cows and pigs. If you caught it at the right time it was pretty good to eat, otherwise it would crack your teeth. It finaly hit me a few years later that \\\"the crucher\\\"  was probably eating the field corn and not munching on bones. After a while, the area started to get built up and we heard less and less of the noise. There was an article in the local paper about the time all this was happening about a family that lived further out, but not that far from us, that was some unusual stuff happening around their home. They were finding what they thought were big nests of leaves around their property and had caught glimpses of something on occasion passing their windows. I still have the article somewhere. It was in the local paper \\\"The Berea Citizen\\\".  I wanted to contact the family but never did, I was afraid of being called a nut (small town). I've only told a few people of this. It still raises the hair on the back of my neck to tell it and, as I just discovered, to write it down.

My grandpa drove a school bus and at about 5;30-6;00 one morning he said that what he thought was a big man with shaggy matted reddish brown hair came out of the woods and stepped up on the road in front of the bus and ran across the road. My grandpa said he thought it was a man until he seen how big it was then he thought it was an ape but it walked like a man only it was slouched over at the shoulders. Some of the old buildings around his house which was close to the sighting at the time had wierd looking hair stuck to the screens where we thought dogs had been going in or something. We never seen anything but we always heard a really scary sound that was like an ape and a chipanzee mixed with human and it would make a screaming howling noise up in the hollow behind there house. The men would all gather up to go out spotting to see if they could find out what it was but they never found anything. When my father seen this creature he was also driving the school bus at about the same time as above he said that there was a path that joined on both sides of the road he said it was a deer run. When he came around the curve there was a big thing that looked like a man and ape with matted patchy red/brown hair like it had been burned or something running down the path so he hit the brakes and the thing ran across the road and down the other path. He watched it til it was gone and then when he got back he was telling my grandpa about it and thats when my grandpa said he seen the same thing about half mile from where my dad seen it. My family still lives in this area of Ky but we haven't heard or seen anything like this. The year would have been the late 70s for I was little then and I am not sure about the month but I might be able to find out. This took place on Rock Run Road in Vanceburg , Ky 41179.  I would love to go looking for tracks and evidence but I am afraid of what I might find while I am by myself so as soon as I get enough family members willing to go tracking we are gonna look and see if there is anything there.

I have had 2 encounters in my lifetime with, what i believe to be, bigfoot/sasquatch. I have told people i have had the encounters, but i have never told any of the details, mainly because I knew no one would believe me if I did. The second encounter, I never really saw the creature, but i know it was there...my first encounter was quite the opposite. i saw the creature up close for at least a few minutes, it was in short, terrifying. My second encounter happened while i was ginseng hunting in late summer. i was right on the outskirts of daniel boone national forest at the rowan/lewis county line in ky just a few hundred yards from cranston rd. i had been in this holler making my way up to the ridge looking for roots for about an hour or so when i heard some brush move about 50 to 75 yrds up the hill from me. i strained hard to see what had made the noise, thinking it may be a deer or maybe even an elk or bear, but saw nothing. As i continued my zig-zag pattern towards the top of the ridge, I heard the noise again. i looked again and saw a flash of black and the brush moved slightly. My next thought was \\\"bear\\\" and not having a firearm with me, i decided it would be best to start back down the hill. as i did, i kept an eye on the area I had seen the movement and to my horror, I realized it was following me down the hill all along making sure it stayed hidden. I could see glimpses of black and the brush and branches move the whole time I was retreating. I know that there is the possibility it was a bear, but what made me so uneasy is the fact that the brush and branches this thing was disturbing were 5 to 6 feet off the ground! knowing that black bears only stand around 3 feet high on all fours and knowing that bears don't move far on two legs (much less several hundred yards) I really believe what was following me down the hill was a bigfoot. my first encounter was in lawrence county ky when i was around 8 years old...i know it was a long time ago, but I know what I saw and i will never forget it as long as i live. we were staying with relatives (I'm not sure of the exact location now) in an isolated holler between two hills with no other houses around. there were quite a few people there and the little house didn't have adequate sleeping room, so we put sleeping bags on the floor in the rooms and my cousins and I slept in the floor beside their parents bed. i have always been the first person awake no matter where i sleep and this morning was no different. It was just breaking daylight, the windows in the bedroom were open because it was hot there in august. As i lay there wondering what we would do that day, i saw a figure pass by outside the window next to the bed. My first thought was someone was up and had to run outside for whatever reason, but as soon as that thought was finished, the figure was looking in the open window by the dresser. Words cannot describe the horror i felt. I had never heard of bigfoot at that time, so i was sure king kong was standing outside looking through the open window. I stayed frozen with fear, knowing if the beast saw me watching, it would attack (that was my thought anyway). The next thing i knew, it reached its arm through the window and grabbed a piece of jewelry from off the dresser. the noise it made caused one of the adults to switch positions in the bed and like a shot, it was gone. I told everyone what had happened and they told me it had been around there for years and not to be afraid, because it had never harmed anyone or anything and that it was more afraid of me than I was of it. I don't know about that, but i do know what i saw.

I was around 10 years old, and had all but forgotten these incidents in the following quarter century. Listening to the HOWL.WAV of the Ohio Bigfoot struck a real responsive chord. If I had to try and duplicate the sound that was heard, that would be as close as I could come. Oh, you may have figured out by this time, we heard a sound. This was in a small, lower middle-class community that was not quite suburbs, not quite farms. Most houses sat on plots of land that were an acre or more. Though there were clusters of them that were spaced more like a regular neighborhood. Over that particular summer, the area was spooked by several nights of \\\"howling\\\". No sightings, that I recall, no tracks, just a low, moaning howl. My mother called me out of the house one night, to see if I could identify the source of this noise. I listened, it was fairly far off and difficult to hear and, of course, every dog in the area was putting their two cents in...and there were a lot of dogs... But it was like nothing I had ever heard before or since. As I said, the Ohio recording comes very close, other than there was maybe more or a moaning quality to what we heard. The serenade went on for five or six minutes, I remember it fading, not just cutting off. Almost as if whatever was howling was moving away from my ear-shot. I'll admit, I was ten years old and it scared the hell out of me. My father worked nights and I was \\\"The Man\\\" of the house when he was away...and I was frightened... The performance repeated a week or so later, this time the howling was closer...A neighbor said he'd pinpointed the source as coming from the flood wall at the end of our road. This was a large, mounded ridge that ran the length of the area and kept the Ohio River from flooding the farmland when it over-flowed its banks. On the other side of the ridge was a VERY deep, fairly thickly wooded \\\"ditch\\\" area. A creek ran through the area that was maybe twelve feet across and three feet deep in places. Forgive my rambling, I am typing all this as it comes to me. I have never sat and sorted this out... The howls came back again at least once, later in the summer. The neighbors were spooked by these incidents, as I said, but I don't believe anything ever came of it. There might have been a local news report on them, but I can't swear to it. Thanks for the opportunity to share this story. Hope it is of some use. Actually, I am hoping someone in particular is drawn to this sight and reads and recognizes this.

In 2003 my wife and I took our daughter and youngest son with our travel trailer to camp at Yatesville Lake State Park in Lawrence county,Ky near Blaine. We arrived on a Friday in August with intent of fishing and I always go on ginseng hunts where I am able/allowed. I think it be noted I am an avid outdoorsman having hunted, fished, hiked, and camped in at least 28 states of the USA for 40+ years. I am well acquainted with big game animals including bears, mountain lions, elk, deer, and wild hogs. I stake my reputation on my word and kept this encounter to myself. On Saturday morning I took my family to fish in the lake at a spot where Highway 32 bridge crosses a fork of Blaine Creek. After my family was set up, I took off into the mountain on the southwest side of this bridge and possibly part of Yatesville Lake WMA to hunt ginseng. As I had worked my way up a long deep hollow and neared the top of the ridge and to my left I heard knocking like someone striking a piece of wood against a tree (similar to what researchers hear/do). I also had several rocks come through the trees from the top of a small cliff at the top of the ridge, but thought they had fell off the rock formations on their own. Then as I happened to look back behind me from the hollow I came out of on the far side of that ridge I saw a very large dark hair covered figure that was watching me and it was standing upright, it definately was not a bear. I estimated later it was near 8' tall, I'm also a carpenter and pretty good at measurements. As silly as it sounds, when it left my sight, I spoke aloud to this \\\"thing\\\" and said \\\"Old one I mean no harm and I'm only taking what I need\\\" all the while easing my way around and down toward my family, once I was out of eyesight I took off down the mountain as fast as I could, I could hear this \\\"bigfoot\\\" following at a distance.

About 5 minutes later i heard him barking loudly like at something and i could tell, I went to the door and yelled for him to get back here thats when i heard him skuffle with something. I could not see him but, then suddenly he came running back fast and ran in the door. I then called my dad which lives right beside me and told him to bring his light and his gun something was outback trying fight the dogs. We started to walk up the hollow and heard really loud crashing and breaking of good size limbs, and also heard a grunting sound a couple time. They move for about 30 seconds very loudy breaking everything it sounded like, I heard alot of animal run in the woods but not any that just run right through the trees most animals will dodge the brush. We held the light up on the hill about 100 feet away for awhile all we heard was one constant sounds in the leaves right in front of us as something else walked around to the right of us. We left right after that because we didnt really hear anything anymore. The next day me and my dad decided that we was going to go look to see how the brush was broke or any kind of sign of what we were dealing with because we have had a big history of dogs just disappearing without a trace, and i have 3 dogs now so i want to protect them from whatever i thought it was. We walked all over the hill only finding spots where it seemed like something was bedding. As we were walking off we decided to walk down an old logging path off the hill, about half down my dad says whats that there and I look and see what looks like a really big human foot print, but like really big with a prominate heel and toes with a arch in the middle of the print. We both looked at it and looked at each other we both knew it looked like no animal track we had ever seen before and we are avid outdoorsmen. We came back down off the hill amazed by what we had found. So I got on the internet that night looking at some bigfoot stuff, i had watch some already and i believed in bigfoot but never really thought i would experience it in my own back yard. So I looked up some stuff and saw that some people had heard a banging stick sound. The next day which was April 15 2010, I went back to the footprint to take pictures, which i have and would love to share. I took the pictures and decided to start banging some sticks together to see if i could call something out. I did it for probably about 10 minutes and was about to stopped i was gonna do it 2 more times. I hit it again and right after i did I heard a loud really high pitch scream/roar that sounds just like the recording that was caught in Ohio in 1994. It scared me so bad I turned and ran a fast as i could down a really steep hill running through briars and everything, i thought i was running for my life. I made it all the way back to the house i had never been that scared in my life. Ive heard almost every animal before even a bobcat and I have no clue what made that sound. I didnt even take time to look back even though i wanted to try to attract it to snap a picture. I am definately a firm believer now and I think if someone could come investigate pretty quick it may still be hanging around.

Once when I was cutting fire wood at dusk and was loading wood something or someone threw a lot of rocks and made a ruckus.

What is surprising is I haven't had to buy any dog food for around three weeks! Again this is down from a 50 lb. dog food bag a week to a 50 lb. bag bought over three weeks ago and the only thing changed is the camera. The other thing is what some call a tree marker. I found this in early Oct. When I went to check on my deer stands. It is made out of two large branches that cross to make a x shape. It also has a twig in the middle that is y shaped upside down. One end of the big branches is stuck in the roots of one tree and the other end is supported by the branch of another tree. The other branch that makes the x has one end stuck in the ground and the other in a branch on another tree (the one with first branch stuck in roots) with a smaller branch put in to hold it. When I first found the x marker the leaves had started falling and I found three of different colors and put them on center twig half way down the y. The next week they was gone. Ok no big deal. Before leaving I put an apple in the crook of the tree the x was on out of reach of deer and placed three more leaves on the y twig, made sure they would stay by breaking the y's end. The next week I went back and no leaves and apple is gone. Maybe some other critter got the apple, I don't know, My game cam is still on dog food. Anyway I left another apple a jar of pb and tied on a piece of blaze orange string on the x. This time a couple of weeks go by and some friends and I go riding and I asked if they would want to see the x. It was night, we rode to the x, apple was there but the peanut butter was missing. We looked around and couldn't find it. I said look for tracks, none found, so we checked out the x and my friend found a hair on the x marker. We went back home and she pulled the hair out of her pocket so we could check it out. It is an inch long and curly but the weird thing is its clear looking. I still have it and pics of the x marker, however what gets me is when I went hunting on the 21st of Nov. I went to the stand by the x marker (10 ft away) and the jar of peanut butter was on my stand with the lid on it and 2/3 missing!!

His house was the only one on the road and was completely surrounded by thick woods. After arriving, I walked to the door and realized nobody was home. As I returned to my bike I heard a loud crash from the side of the house, I quickly looked ad saw a large black figure tearing a huge limb from a tree. The figure was at least 7-8 feet tall and covered in thick black hair, couldn't guess the weight, but it was big. The figure was standing upright and was looking right at me, it was no bear. I quickly jumped on my bike and peddled like hell toward the main road. The ride back to the main road seemed to take forever and the entire distance back I could hear branches breaking and what appeared to be heavy footsteps running along side me; I was terrified. I thought for sure I was about to be attacked, then I hit the main road and it stopped. I kept riding, but couldn't help but wonder why whatever it was stopped chasing me once I hit the road. I don't know what it was, but I do know if it were a bear it wouldn't have stopped, and it was fast because it was able to catch a terrified kid peddling his butt off.

I had been hearing this odd \\\"tapping\\\" noise all the while, and saw this dark brownish figure near a log close to the thicket some 250 yards away (I have a hard time determining distance, so it could more or less) At first I thought it a rare sighting of a black bear, but when I looked at it through the bin's, I couldn't believe what I saw. It was sitting on a log with it's back to me, with a rock in its hand beating on this logs side. It had a back that was at least 2.5 feet across and covered in short, thick reddish brown hair. It looked like a giant hair covered man with no neck. With the bins I could see in good detail, so there was no mistake. The hands looked human, four fingers and a thumb, the skin a dark greyish color. The head was conical, like a lowland gorilla. Suddenly this thing must have smelled or sensed me, because it stood up and looked in my direction. It had a bulged forehead near the eyebrow, large round dark eyes, and a flared gorilla like nose. The jaw was slightly long to the chest, but did not protrude at the mouth. the nose and eyes areas was free of hair, the skin a dark grey. but from the nose, mouth, and chin were covered in hair. (Sort of like a hairy ninja hood). The creature was HUGE! I later looked at a tree it was standing near and it had to be near 7ft tall. It stared up the mountain at me, and made a peculiar motion with its head, waving it from side to side, and seemed to hunch over a bit with its arms dangling at it's knees.

As we were heading out we stopped so everyone could catch up because some had utility quads and some had racing quads, as we waited was when the first incident took place, as we sat we heard a branch snap like it was being deliberately snapped to let us know we were not alone, it was about 50 yards to our left in thick brush, we sat there quiet and just waited to see what would happen next, I have hunted deer before and it did not sound like large game traveling thru brush, it was a single snap, no brush or leaves moving like when a animal walks, also you heard no noise at all, dead silent, insects stopped making noises, you could hear a needle drop.

It was a warm sunny summer day and we have been playing in the woods much of the day. In fact J. (the oldest of us five brothers) had made a path doen the hill and had just riden his bike (without brakes) down the hill and hit some rock and had flipped over the handle bars. It was also a place that we use to play cowboy and indians. It was geeting late in the evening, around 7-8 PM. My brother D. was the last one to leave the wood that day when he came running back screaming that he had just seen a hairy monster. When we all went back there we could see nothing but there was a strange smell in the air that stunk and we thought that a animal had died and started to rot so played it off like he didn't see anything. That night he drew a picture of what he saw and it looked just like some of the drawings of bigfoot that I have seen as of today. Anyways us boys all went down to where he said he seen the thing and we notice large footprints just noticable to the eye because it was so dry but there was a little spring running in the middle of the woods and there where some soft ground that the footprints where made in. They looked just like a human footprint but very big. We all tried to get our Mother and Step-Father to come down and look at them but they just thought we where being kids. Still this day my brother swears he saw Bigfoot that day and I do believe him. At the time of the sightings our ages where:::: 12,  9,  8,  6, and  4. As you can see that we all where very young and the one who saw it was only 6 at the time so you see why no one believed us at the time. I still remember that day like it was yesterday because of the fright in my brothers eyes when he came out of the woods that day. Like I said this is very old but my brother who was 6 at the time still remembers it. I still remember seeing the footprints swallowing my barefoot when I place it in it.

My friend was taking his turn at driving and I was soaking up as much as I could see as well as providing a running commentary to keep my friend alert during our long drive. As we came around a curve in the road our high beams illuminated a large dark shaggy figure coming up out of the ditch on the left side (south)of the road at a distance of about 200 -250 ft. As we approached the figure at a speed of about 45 miles per hour, it looked first at the vehicle (we noticed the yellow reflection from it's eyes that is seen in a dog's eye when light catches it at night) then deliberately turned it's head away from the lights. That motion was non-human or bearlike, in that the the shoulders, chest and head moved simultaneously as it caught site of our vehicle and then turned it's face away from the headlights. We slowed (OK , we slammed on the brakes), stunned at what we were seeing and trying to rationalize we were looking at. A hominid creature, perhaps 7 to 7.5 ft in height (we have a 7 foot friend as a reference), massing perhaps 600 to 800 pounds without obvious signs of obesity, standing completely and comfortably upright, came up out of the ditch from the left side of the road right at the edge of the metal barrier above the culvert. It took 3 extrodinarily long and fluid strides across the highway (22 ft) and another 3 of 4 shorter strides down the other side of the road actually appearing to catch hold of the metal barrier/railing with one long fingered hairy hand and swinging down under the road into the box culvert or channel bottom completely out of our line of site. We stopped the vehicle within 25 feet of the culvert and watched the final decent of the creature into the darkness of the channel. At this point we speed on toward the east gate of YNP hoping to find a ranger to report the siting to and perhaps to go back and take another look. There was no one at the gate due to the late hour and we didn't see any lights on anywhere, so we continued on to our destination and went to bed deciding not to contaminate each others observations with discussions until morning. In the morning we both independently described graphically and in writing as much of what we had seen 6 hours earlier. This is a synopsis of our findings. There were virtually identical down to the movment of which leg moved first as the creature crossed the road. The head appeared to merge into the neck and there was no snout or protrusion from the face as would be commonly seen in a bear (I've seen hundreds, up close and in person) The face was not clearly visible and was only glimpsed for a moment. We both got an impression of long hair covering some of it. The nostrils were large and open, but neither of us were able to describe mouth or teeth. The eyes weren't exceptional, just the reflection of gold, like a dog's. What each of us can still describe with great clarity in the size, shape and unique fluid movment of the creature. It was big, 7-7.5 ft ish, but not much bigger than that. It was heavy and powerful looking. In shape, it possessed a rather blocky, yet elongated head,slightly domed on top of the cranium, thick short neck, broad shoulders, full chest. It was square and longer through the torso and hips than a human. As it walked across the road in front of us, the buttocks were clearly seen as muscular masses moving under heavy shaggy hair, they obviously attached to long powerful, muscular thighs longer in proportion to a human, big knees that functioned as a human knee, thick mulcular calves and feet in proportion to the rest of the oversized body. The soles of the feet appeared to be hairless or less covered in hair and very dark in color. The arms hung from heavily muscled shoulders and were longer than a human reaching to knee length and extending fully and almost a horizontal positon to the front and rear of the body as it moved. The elbows were perhaps a little further down the arm that on a human - or the unusual length of the arm made it appear so. The hands were large and long fingered, neither of us could later describe the palms, nails, or other than the backs of the hands which were covered in the same long shaggy dark brown hair as the rest of the creature. The creature made no sound nor gesture throughout the siting. It appeared a little startled at our vehicle appearing out of the night, but in no other way frightened or threatening.

At first I concluded that it must be a bear or elk and pointed it out to my brother. My brother fetched the binocs from the pickup to have a closer look, as we are hunters and like to keep track of where we see elk. At first he seemed startled in that he didn't recognize what he was looking at. Rather than jump to a conclusion, he handed me the glasses and asked me to look. By the time I got the glasses up, the animal had disappeared into the tree line and I couldn't see it. Shortly after, I noticed it again lower down on the slope in a clearing, moving all the while. At this point I would estimate the creature at a quarter mile from us, moving closer (downslope towards the river). This time I got a good look at it through the glasses. It was definitely upright, walking on two legs. Though there is no way to say at this distance, the specimen appeared to be between 6 and 10 feet in height. More striking, however, was its mass. The creature, covered in dark hair, almost seemed fat. Maybe obese. This was no bear. I saw it walk for a good 100 yards and it never came down on all fours. There is something on the North Fork that I have sure never seen before. About half an hour after my last sighting, we were loading the truck. The chainsaw wasn't running so we could hear reasonably well (the river makes some noise).

While traveling the highway to Yellowstone National Park, about 30 or 40 miles west of Cody, I encountered heavy tourist traffic late in the day. I decided, rather than fight it, to pull off the highway for a while and go for a walk. I hiked up an unmarked path north of the highway through intermittent timber. I was traveling at a leisurely pace, exploring rocky outcrops and looking for Native American artifacts. About half a mile from the road (I could still hear traffic), I heard some rocks rolling down hill ahead of and above me. It was maybe 50 to 100 yards away. Mule dear and other game animals are plentiful in the area and I didn\\u2019t think much of it. I had bear spray with me as this is well known Grizzly country. Maybe another half an hour went past and I was taking a break, sitting on a rock ledge with a good view of the valley to the south. I heard underbrush breaking not far away on a steep, timber-covered slope that led down to a dry stream bed. I was able to distinguish the pattern of an animal walking through the trees. Again, I didn\\u2019t think much of it. I\\u2019m used to hearing game in the woods and don\\u2019t spook at stuff like that. I guessed that it was probably dear feeding along the slope (a little odd considering the time of day). Its behavior was highly inconsistent with bears, which don\\u2019t hang around when people show up. I started hiking again and almost immediately heard something move through the brush just below me in the same spot. This was a little strange I thought, like it was staying with me or something. I tried to see down the hill, but when I stopped I couldn\\u2019t hear it. It seemed to stop moving when I did and I couldn\\u2019t get a fix on its location. I began to get a somewhat uneasy feeling about things at this point. There is no good way to describe it other than something seemed to be intentionally staying with me. I started walking again and, shortly after (not having heard anything for a little while), I heard something run across the rocks not far up in front of me. It was up out of the drainage at this point. I was getting a little apprehensive by this time and decided to start back towards the road, which was maybe a mile away. I walked pretty quickly and for most of the way I heard nothing. But about a quarter mile or so from the highway and maybe 15 minutes since I turned back, I heard rocks and debris falling downslope again. It seemed awfully close and I instinctively whirled around thinking that I might see something, which I did. I will do my best to describe it, but, as I got only a short glimpse, I can\\u2019t be too sure of what it was. It was about 60 or 70 yards away on a rocky slope, immediately adjacent to the same heavily timbered slope I had been hiking along. As soon as I turned and looked at it, it jumped right away into the cover and completely out of sight. There is one thing I am absolutely certain of. Whatever it was, it was upright. I clearly could see two limbs off the ground that appeared more like arms than legs. They were definitely hanging down the side, and not down the front as one might expect of a four-legged animal standing on two legs. This doesn\\u2019t mean that it wasn\\u2019t a bear, but I\\u2019ve never heard of a bear acting like this thing was. That is if I\\u2019m right, and it was the same animal that I feel was following me all along. You hear about predatory bear behavior where they follow people though, so who knows. At any rate, the animal was brown with very long hair. I noticed that when it leapt into the woods, the hair swayed to one side from the sudden motion. It seemed longer than bear hair, and to notice this swaying effect at this distance I would guess that maybe the hair was a foot long or more. Also, for just that initial instant before its flight, I got a pretty good look at its face, which was long and somewhat flat. It was too far away to clearly make out individual features, but I have seen several bears at greater distances and it doesn\\u2019t strike me that that\\u2019s whatit was. I was not aware of this site at the time, nor of the occurrences detailed in it for this area. When I mentioned the incident to a friend, who had not heard of the site either, we did a net search on Bigfoot out of curiosity. I was a little astonished to see the main page indicating this region as potential Bigfoot country with recent sightings. I figured I might as well say something. I think all three of the other incidents had witnesses, and I didn\\u2019t. So I can\\u2019t point to another who can verify anything I saw or heard. It would have been nice just to see if someone else had seen something resembling what I think I saw. Trust me, it takes a little bit of time for it to register. You just don\\u2019t think right off, hey, there\\u2019s Bigfoot. I was probably almost at my vehicle before I even let that thought enter my mind. I can\\u2019t say for sure that what I saw is what I had been hearing in the woods throughout the hike. One tends to make thes!! e connections afterwards, but I really have no way of knowing. I will say, however, that I think it might have been. This is based more on a feeling than anything else. I realize that breaking branches and rock slides don\\u2019t exactly constitute scientific certainty. It really was like something was checking me out though.\", \"location_details\": \"The incident happened about 30 to 40 miles west of Cody.

I asked my wife...prior to telling her about the skookum cast article or the information on your site... about whether she remembered me saying anything on the way to Cody when we left Yellowstone during our trip there. She said all she remembered was me joking about seeing Bigfoot. I wanted to be sure it wasn't a \\\"manufactured memory\\\" because sometime had passed. It was a long day...we had seen lots of wildlife and finished with a nursing grizzly with 2 cubs just before leaving the park. What I saw reminded me of a moose in color.

Range above Lake Tahoe and the Carson Valley above the town Genoa.  Both of us grew up in this area.  Although in high school I was kind of a cut up, my friend Linda, graduated valedictorian of our class 5 years earlier.  She is very logical.  We have often hiked this trail that basically goes straight up the mountain and over to Tahoe.  It is a strenuous hike.  When we parked our truck at the trailhead there was another car parked there as well.  We were 1/4 the way up the trail when two teenage boys came running down the mountain towards us.  The trail was extremely steep and they were running for all they were worth.  They stopped long enough to implore us not to go any further up the mountain as they had seen a monster or something.  There was an old deer hunter's cabin at about the half way point and we told the boys that we were only going to go that far.  (We thought they were drinking or on drugs) We shrugged off the incident laughed and joked that we wished we had what they were \\\"smoking.\\\" We reached the cabin without incidence sat down on the bluff that overlooked the Carson Valley we split a soda that we had brought and I took out my recorder (flute like instrument) and began playing some little tunes on it.  We were alone on the mountain we thought. After about an hour of putsing around we decided to head back down the trail.  I kept smelling dog doo or something dead.  I even checked my shoes.  We were near the creek gathering pine cones for an art project, I was facing downhill, Linda was facing uphill, we were examining a particularly perfect cone when Linda looked up and exclaimed, \\\"Oh, my God it's a bear, no....it's a guy in a bear suit!\\\"  I looked up and couldn't believe it, we were a stone toss from a 7 ft. hairy dude.  He looked directly at us and to this day Linda and I felt something pass between the three of us.  He stood across the creek from us.  His hair was the color of dry pine needles and covered his whole body with the hair thinning just on his chest and face. He had a large broad chest, but not breasts like a female, his arms were hanging at his sides nearly to his knees and when he walked, he took long strides and his arms swung freely as he walked. He didn't seem to fear us although he began to walk straight up a pine needle covered slope, barefooted, without slipping. As he moved away Linda grabbed my arm and began dragging me down the hill I couldn't take my eyes off him and he never took his eyes off us.  I do not feel to this day as he meant to harm us but instead I feel he was just as fascinated with us as we were with him.  His face seemed almost serene with very intelligent eyes - his face resembled an orangutan. He had large eyes and a flattish nose I sketched a picture as soon as I got home and Linda confirmed that I had captured his likeness - I wished I had a camera on me that day.  As we continued at a fast pace down the hill he remained on the ridge above us paralleling in the same direction. We reached our truck and could still see him crouching on a granite boulder at least a football field distance between us.  I yelled up to him that he was very cool but he shouldn't be scaring the crap out of us locals.  He stood up on his boulder and Linda told me to shut up and get in the truck.  We were strangely disturbed that afternoon and evening.  We thought of going to the forest service or the sheriff\\u2019s dept.  But crimeny sakes, who would've believed us?  Plus in our community they would just want to shoot him. We have since hiked there many times.  Always hoping to catch another glimpse.  We are married ladies with kids and we take the kids up \\\"Bigfoot Canyon\\\" periodically in search of our elusive friend. A few years ago the wind blew down some trees during a storm and exposed an area that we had not seen from the trail before.  When we went up to investigate we found a large boulder and some older pine trees with branches low to the ground around it.  You could duck down and go under the trees near the wall of the boulder and it looked as if something or someone had made a natural shelter there.  The pine needles had all been tramped down and it seemed to be away from the prevailing winds.  A great place for deer, bear or perhaps a bigfoot.  We hope so.  I will never look at life on this earth the same way.  I have seen bigfoot and not only does it make for a great tale around the campfires at night, it fuels my imagination about every little sound I hear when I am in the wilderness.  I am intrigued.  I only hope that no harm comes to the Bigfoots.  I believe that the great creator of all life shares the sight of the Bigfoot with people who might grow from the experience. I know Linda and I have both grown.  Even if we share the experience with someone who doesn't believe us - it really does not matter.  We know what we saw.

Subsequently, Vince Lauria and myself met with the witness on March 19, 2003 and conducted a personal interview and had the witness take us to the actual sighting location. The following is the account of the sighting as told to us by the witness. On February 18, 2003 at approx. 5:30 AM, the witness was heading eastbound on Interstate 10 when he saw what he first believed to be a person stepping out onto the highway just as a tractor-trailer rig had passed it. Because the tractor-trailer rig's rear lights illuminated the animal he was able to see it.  The witness tapped his brakes to disengage the cruise control and turned on his high beams. He stated to us that his first thought was perhaps someone had broken down on the Interstate or been involved in an accident but when he got a better look at it, he realized it wasn't human. He stated that, \\\"its hands hung almost to its knees and it moved in a hunched posture.\\\" When questioned further, the witness stated that it moved with its knees bent in \\\"almost a glide\\\" and that its arms stayed by its side as opposed to swinging back and forth. He further described the creature as being approximately 7' in height; 250 to 275 pounds with a muscular, \\\"squatty\\\" build and was covered with reddish hair. The head appeared to sit directly on the shoulders and was somewhat pointed. A note of interest; the witness told us the hair on it's head looked \\\"slicked back\\\" as if it had just been combed, not as if it were wet. He also stated that the creature never looked toward his truck so he didn't notice any facial detail. According to the witness, the creature wasn't running but was moving \\\"at a good trot\\\". It crossed both traffic lanes and the breakdown lane in 4 or 5 steps. At the time of the sighting, the creature was approximately sixty to seventy yards from the witness, and the sighting lasted about thirty seconds, maximum.\", \"location_details\": \"Interstate 10, east of Caryville\", \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Florida\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 5884: Road crossing sighting by motorist\", \"latitude\": 30.7599, \"longitude\": -85.76890999999999, \"date\": \"2003-02-18\", \"number\": 5884.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dj7nbr8vrs\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-85.76890999999999 30.7599)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was walking home from fishing, taking a different trail. As I got about 2/3rds. up the hill I had the hair on my neck stand up and a feeling like I was being watched. This was around 5:00pm. I just casually kept walking till I got home always checking my back. It happened again within a week. Maybe a few days. Did not smell anything cause I had been fishing or no smell anyway. Wasn't long afterwards I was checking on the clouds of a thunderstorm when lightning struck close to the trailer. By this I mean I had my head out the door. I heard a yell about 70yds. behind the trailer. It didn't sound like a cow but I checked anyway. No cows had been in the area for at least 6 months. The scream was high pitched without coming down a lot at the end. With my wife being there, I just closed the door and didn't say nothing. I would say the following Sunday afternoon, my wife went to church at 6:00pm. and I stayed home to watch TV. About 45 min. later, I was laying on the couch watching TV, when something had blacked out my window at the far end of my trailer. The window was 1ft. wide and 3ft. tall. I had raised up to look out my picture window above the couch and it turned the corner and walked around the steps at the back door. It was looking off into the woods and as it kept walking, it looked at the ground. Understand this though, I had clear plastic on my window to keep heat in from winter.(Hadn't taken it down yet.) When it got to the window, I had already laid back down on the couch, looking up and lay still. It looked down at me and kept walking, hopefully. I laid there for about as long as I could stand maybe a minute. Then I got off the couch by sliding on the floor, went and got my gun walked back in the living room and waited a minute, then went outside making all noise I could. I checked the back of the trailer, nothing there. Details of Bigfoot is as follows, he was about 7ft. tall maybe 7ft.3\\\". Solid black, no white or brown that I could see. Remember the plastic. His head was more rounded and not cone shaped. I could not see the color of his eyes or anything like that. He was broad shouldered and thinner around the waist than what you usually see in the pictures and he walked more upright, not humped over like a gorilla. His hands hung around his thighs. The next morning around 10:00am., I got up from bed as I worked 2rd. shift then. My wife told me a friend of mine had come down to see me. I asked what did he want. She said she only saw him as the top of his head went across the kitchen window. We had to set the trailer on 4 blocks high and 3 on the other end, which meant you could not see anyone walking in front of the trailer, not out the kitchen window anyway. I told her my friend was 6'4\\\" and with a hat on you could not see him the way she had told me. We lived on rocky ground but I had one dusty dirt spot at the end of the trailer. Hoping he had walked in it. I checked and in the middle was a footprint. It was about 12 and a half inches long and 3 and half to 4 inches wide at the heel. Being dust it was only 1/4\\\" deep. There were only 3 toes which I did not  understand at the time. I told some friends at work and one came to see it. The following Friday or Saturday night, he and a friend of his came over, no drinking sorry. And I told them the whole story. My friend was not hard to convince but his friend started talking big. So I told them let's go outside. Joking around to see how brave he was when we heard two dogs about medium to small size started barking and chasing something on the other ridge behind my trailer. Which was not far at all, maybe 200yds. They chased it into the small valley about 50yds. south of us. When one dog quit barking, the other gave one more then it was quiet. Stunned, we looked at each other and Bigfoot started running back towards us. It stopped about 80yds. from us and started to hit a tree with something that sounded like a branch about 4 to 5 inches thick. Then it ran closer to about 40yds. and done the same thing again. By this time all bravery was gone. I went back in the trailer and got my gun. Come back out and asked if anything had happened. The brave guy thought he might had seen something in the shadows south of us, light was on of course. They took the gun away from me and I didn't mind, thinking I had a way of escape. But we heard nothing else. My nearest neighbor is about 250 yds. away.( Mother-in-law) No one else for at least a mile. No reason to mess with us that I could even think of.

The night was dead silent with no wind. Upon reaching the bottom of the ramp I began to turn to my right towards the car when I heard what can only be described as similar to a bull snorting mixed with a grunt.  I immediately turned towards the location of the sound, the back of the carport, and drew my sidearm.  Due to a light on in the carport being pointed directly at me, I could not see what it was, but a shape.  I had a small flashlight on me and pointed it at the thing.  It didn't help much due to the light being in my eyes, but I was able to make out a creature bigger than me and at least 3 ft across at the shoulder. It made the sound again, but didn't move. I called out to it, thinking it was a person, but no response.  After what felt like a few minutes, it made the sound again and seemed to get shorter. I began to move to my right towards the car to retrieve a rifle I kept in there and the thing moved to my left, so that we effectively circled each other until it reached the end of the carport on the south end.  I reached the car and without turning, retrieved my rifle.

From looking at disturbed spots on the ground I could tell that whatever it was, it had padded feet with a step of about 3-4ft., was between 7-9ft. tall, and moved in an upright fashion on two legs. Since then it hasn't been seen again, but there are times when the guard dog mysteriously disappears and there is no sound outside.  the whole incident lasted 10 mts. or so.

I was roughly 75ft from the fence when this occurred.  My jack russell dog saw them and took aften them. He often follows me hunting as this place is next to my house.  After chasing them for about 10 mins he comes back towards me when he suddenly stops, looks towards the pine thicket, lets out a weird yelp and takes off towards the house visibly something wrong.  I stood there and heard a noise and the deer that had ran by came back by as if something had spooked them again.  As they came back up the hill I heard what appeared to be a large animal coming from the thicket.  I thought it was another deer that had separated from the herd and was coming back to join up.  As I watched something on two legs appeared roughly 100ft from my position from out of the thicket.  It came down the fence line and went over the fence in the direction of the deer.

This noise occured about three times withine a 15 second time frame.

I live in Springdale, Ar. Springdale is not very rugged as far as forest goes, but it can get pretty secluded in the right places. On october 10,2002 me and a friend set out on a trip to follow a creek to see how far it goes, because i followed this creek when i was young. This creek goes through springdale, and winds in through Elm springs,wheres theres nothing but dense trees on one side the left, and open fields, to the right-private properity. Well Elm springs is not a big city, and you would never know the surrundings where i was not unless you owend the properity.It was about 5:00 pm when i decided that it was time to try to get out of the creek and up on the bank,we had been walking about 2 hours in and out of the creek,and i decided that we could cover more ground on land before the sun went down. Now im about 5\\\"9 and i guess the creek bed must have been 7 foot high,so i had my friend C hoist my foot up while i got my knee up high enough to pull myself up.Now the original plan was to yank him up once on top,but looking back on it now i realize how foolish this was because i would had to be extremely strong,because i probably could have just have barely have had touched his fingertips from way up there,but it didnt matter because what i saw when i got on my feet scared the crap out of me. The best way to explain it is just to tell you that my heart sunk,and I was just extremely stunned. When i got to my feet i was facing nothing but dense forests or woods,somthing caught the corner of my eye about lets say 75 to 100 yards off. Just before getting a good enough look at it i could tell it was big and brown,now ive never seen a bear before out in the wild, so imediately i started to panic. I took one quick look down and figured i would break every bone in my legs if i were to jump,for the water was only maybe a foot deep, with all this happening in what i would say just about 2 seconds,and keep in mind i havent even been able to warn my friend yet of what i thought to be a charging bear, i look back to see this thing or whatever it was walking extremely fast! It was then i noticed that this couldnt have been a bear. I got a clear look at it for just a second.Ill never forget what i saw that day.I remember its head, real long head,i guess you could say it was shaped like an egg, i just know it wasnt like a humans, the eyes must have been dark because i couldnt make them out,i didnt reall notice a nose ether, but there was so much hair, it was hard to make anything out except for the head.The biggest thing ill never forget is the height and weight of this thing.It was so big,legs coverd with hair, so massive,that had to have been the biggest part of this thing,so wide,had to have been as wide as a refrigerator.In comparing the legs to my legs i would have to say each leg made two sets of both of my legs.The shouldars were massive,could have been three feet or over from shoulder to shoulder.I also remember how it walked, besides taking extremely wide steps, it kind of walked with its front body slightly hunched over,i dont know, like some one with bad posture.The height of this thing was astronomical.The tip of its head was in the tree tops!!! now dont get me wrong, the trees werent that tall, but they were at least 8 to 9 feet where the limbs started to curl out and i remember the head was up there with them, there is no way i could have jumped and touched the limbs, they were just to high up.So i would put whatever it was that i seen to be 8 to 9 foot tall. And looking back on it now, the frame could have easily held 500- 600 pounds,the arms on it looked long, and they swayed back in forth heavily,i do not recall a odor,or anything like that,for this thing was out of my view in about id say 5 to 7 seconds. Now i realize when i was getting up the creek bed, i had spooked the thing,because it sure didnt waste no time getting gone into the woods.And i was not about to follow it.So with all this said,i asked my friend if he had heard anything,which he said no because of the running water,and i guess because he was down there,and i said man,i just seen a monster go into the woods! ofcourse my facial feachure was very solemn and serious,but he still didnt believe me.I repeated this several times to him,and i guess he could tell by looking at my face i was serious.He later said my face looked white. With his help i got down back into the creek,but it did take a few minutes,and even then i wound up falling back down in the creek,luckly i wasnt hurt,just wet and scared,the sun was setting,and we jogged and trampled our way back,never once daring to go back up on land. We talked and thought better of muterring such foolishness around for fear of people thinking were nuts. Truthfuly,i dont even think he beleives me.But putting myself in his shoes i probably wouldnt either.But it doesnt matter, i know what i saw, so in closing i have ruled out the possbility of a hoax,1. why would somebody be out in the middle of nowhere in this kind of costume? 2. how would they know we were coming?3.how do you account for the height and size, it was easily a foot taller than any human ive ever seen.It was so tall,you cant duplicate that kind of height.Ihope someone reads this and takes it seriously because i dont know if ill ever go into the woods again.\", \"location_details\": \"Im not familiar with location,me and my friend followed Spring creek from Springdale into Elm Springs,where there is only dense woods,id say about five miles into Elm Springs,out of the creek bed,to the left,about fifty yards off.\", \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Arkansas\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 5316: Daytime sighting by hiker near Spring Creek.\", \"latitude\": 36.20611, \"longitude\": -94.23417, \"date\": \"2002-10-10\", \"number\": 5316.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9ykvzxhgbs\", \"temperature_high\": 66.2, \"temperature_mid\": 63.63, \"temperature_low\": 61.06, \"dew_point\": 55.66, \"humidity\": 0.86, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.16, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1016.99, \"summary\": \"Overcast throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 8.74, \"wind_bearing\": 68.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.92, \"location\": \"POINT(-94.23416999999999 36.206109999999995)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Driving on paved road, sighting was maybe 20 yards away, creature exited woods as I crested a hill, crossed right of way and road with four-five strides at incredible speed. 8-9 feet tall, extremely broad shoulders, matted reddish-brown fur.

The date of my encounter was either Wednesday morning, April 19 or Thursday morning, April 20, 2006.  The reason I am not certain of the date is that I do not keep a daily journal, and I cannot remember if I left home for my 3-day, 2-night turkey hunt on Monday or Tuesday.  Whatever the case, the encounter happened on the final morning of my hunt. At midday on Monday or Tuesday, I launched my canoe at the Rush, Arkansas landing on the Buffalo River.  Rush is between the towns of Yellville and Harriet in the heart of the Ozark Mountains.  Before getting to the river, I had my last association with another human until two-plus days later.  I had purposefully planned my trip for mid-week while school was still in session, most adults were at work, the summer canoeists had not begun their season, and probably few other turkey hunters would be out hunting.  Indeed I did not see nor hear another person on my trip. I floated only about one mile downstream from Rush to the spot where Silver Hollow empties into the Buffalo River.  I pulled off on river right (the south side of the river), and pitched my tent camp to be used for the next two nights.  I turkey hunted in Silver Hollow that afternoon and all the second day.  This entire region is mature deciduous woodland with a sprinkling of pines and cedars on certain slopes and bluffs.  Spring was just springing.  The dogwoods were blooming, and all the deciduous trees had just begun to leaf out. Silver Hollow is nearly pristine.  I saw no sign of humans having been in that 1.5-mile long hollow in many years.  There are a few signs of very old activity from 70+ years ago when some mining took place, but otherwise it was just me, the turkeys, and numerous species of neotropical songbirds (warblers, vireos, tanagers, and others) that had returned for the summer. I had heard several gobblers over the course of my 1.5 days hunting, but I had been unsuccessful in taking one.  As the second day came to a close, I returned to my camp and made a plan for the final morning\\u2019s hunt.  I was to awake at 4:15 a.m., eat my Cheerios breakfast, and then hike by flashlight 1.5 miles up Silver Hollow to set up where I\\u2019d heard a gobbler late the second evening. My watch-alarm awoke me at 4:15 a.m. on the final morning.  I lit the dim lantern at my campsite, and sat down to eat my Cheerios.  The last quarter moon was overhead shedding a small amount of light onto the otherwise very dark landscape.  It was chilly (probably mid-40\\u2019s degrees F), and there was no wind.  There was not a sound to be heard \\u2013 no crickets, no Whippoorwills, nothing, owing to the cool, crisp, calm morning.  While eating, I was sitting facing northward into the darkness across the Buffalo River. As I was eating, the silence was broken by a loud, clear \\u201choooOOO-op\\u201d call from the mountainside behind my left shoulder to the southwest of me.  I immediately stopped in mid-crunch to soak in the brief, 1.5-second call I was hearing.  Within two seconds and before I had resumed crunching, an even louder, clear \\u201choooOOO-op\\u201d call came from the mountainside on the north side of the river.  This call was to the northwest of me.  The second call was not an echo of the first call.  It was a second animal responding to the first.  There were no 90-degree cliff faces in the area to have created an echo.  Besides, the second call was louder than the first, with no hint of echo after either call. So, I was sitting there thinking with a mouth full of Cheerios, \\u201cWhat on earth could have made those calls?\\u201d  I am a lifelong birder.  I have seen all but two of the approximately 650 regularly-occurring North American bird species.  Furthermore, I can identify more than 600 of those species by song or call note alone.  I immediately ruled out all birds as having made the sounds, even the Barred Owl which has quite a repertoire.  My mind turned to the mammals \\u2013 coyote, fox, bobcat, otter, etc.  I quickly ruled out all of those.  Mountain lion maybe?  I have never seen or knowingly heard a mountain lion in the wild.  However, once I returned home from this trip, I listened to every mountain lion vocalization I could find on the Internet, and I ruled out the mountain lion. But still, as I continued eating my bowl of Cheerios, I kept thinking, \\u201cThe sounds I just heard were distinctly human/primate in quality.\\u201d  At that point in my life (I was 43 years old), I had done enough self-study to be a believer in the existence of Sasquatch.  But I didn\\u2019t think too much about Sasquatch in my everyday life.  I certainly started thinking about Sasquatch as I was finishing my cereal that morning!  I am not frightened by knowing Sasquatch is out there, but I have a scientific curiosity about the animal. Soon, during my hour-long hike by flashlight up Silver Hollow, I kept replaying what I\\u2019d heard over and over in my mind.  About 1/3 of the way up the hollow, I shined my flashlight into the cave opening that I\\u2019d hiked past several times in the past two days.  I thought, \\u201cYou know, there is no sign of man at this cave entrance \\u2013 no trash, no footprints, no graffiti.  There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of caves like this in these hollows, and many thousands of caves throughout the whole Ozark Mountain region.  Sasquatches live here.  They have protection from the elements.  They\\u2019re largely nocturnal.  They avoid man.  The vast majority of canoeists who pour down the Buffalo River in the summer don\\u2019t leave the riverside, so the canoeists are no bother to the Sasquatch.  Those few canoeists who spend the night in a tent on the riverside may be unknowingly sleeping within 100 yards of Sasquatches.  Sasquatch doesn\\u2019t bother the people, and the people never know the animal is near. I hunted that morning, did not bag a turkey, and I broke camp about noon.  I paddled back upriver one mile to my car, loaded up, and drove 2 hours home to central Arkansas. I believe the first call I had heard at 4:30 a.m. on that dark, calm, chilly morning in the Lower Buffalo Wilderness Area was a Sasquatch announcing, \\u201cI\\u2019m right here.\\u201d  Within two seconds, the Sasquatch on the north side of the river responded with, \\u201cI\\u2019m over here across the river.\\u201d  Perhaps it was their way of saying that daylight is coming in another hour or so, and maybe it\\u2019s about time to call it a night. I estimate that each Sasquatch was roughly 1/4 to 1/3 mile from me at the time of the vocalizations.  The three of us formed more-or-less of an equilateral triangle. Why do I think that the sounds did not come from humans? First, I don\\u2019t think there were any humans within earshot of me during my trip \\u2013 not even another turkey hunter.  I had not heard even a gunshot during the whole trip, and 2006 was the final year of a good turkey population in Arkansas. Second, humans have much more sophisticated ways of communicating with each other than yelling \\u201choooOOO-op\\u201d at 4:30 a.m. from one mountainside to another across the Buffalo River in a designated Wilderness Area during mid-week in mid-April (!). Third, gorillas and chimpanzees are known to make sounds like I am describing. And fourth, for those of you convinced that Sasquatch exists, you know that Sasquatch is known to make such vocalizations. I am a scientist.  I have a Chemical Engineering degree, and I have been actively practicing the profession for 24 years in the plastics and chemical industries.  For those readers of this story who approach nearly every aspect of your life with a strong scientific bent like I do, you already know that Sasquatch exists.  You have seen the Patterson/Gimlin film from the late 1960\\u2019s near the California/Oregon border, and you know it could not have been a hoax.  The animal videoed was a real, in-the-flesh adult female Sasquatch.  You have further educated yourself with the stories from thousands of people over the decades and centuries who have described seeing a creature with a remarkably consistent set of features \\u2013 large, tall, hairy, muscular, wide shoulders, no neck, cone head, long arms, big feet, smelly.  Your knowledge of the fundamentals (or the entire science) of statistics tells you plainly that the probability that all of these thousands of people are wrong is essentially nil. And then you think more about the multitude of reports.  One person is not reporting seeing a white elephant here, another a purple tiger there, and yet another a green velociraptor somewhere else. They are all seeing a Sasquatch \\u2013 a large, tall, hairy, muscular, \\u2026 creature.\", \"location_details\": \"Rush is between the towns of Yellville and Harriet.

I was out of school at the time, and my best friend and I were out partaking in one of our favorite pastimes: spelunking of the amatueur sort.  Our particular goal that day was the finding of a cave called Turner's Cave, one we'd heard about from my parents who said it had been a designated government fallout shelter.  We knew of one that might qualify, as it had a large entrance and such, but it didn't seem large enough for a fallout shelter to us.  We explored it once more (we'd been in it before), and then decided to move on down the creekbed and try to find another that might be it. The creekbed was dry, so the walking was easy.  About a quarter-mile or so downstream from the cave's entrance, we happened upon an old logging road and decided to check out the other side of the ridge, as this side wasn't looking promising.  We followed the logging road, which ascended the ridge at an angle, until we reached the top. At the top, the woods ended at a fenceline which bordered open pasture.  It was about noon by then, maybe early afternoon, and we decided to sit down and take a break, as it was hot.  So we crossed the fence and sat down on the grass of the pasture. We had been sitting thus for probably five or ten minutes when I realized I was hearing something in the woods behind me.  Growing up in the country, I was used to hearing animals in the leaves of the forest floor, but I think what made me actually pay attention to this one was that I realized that it wasn't moving in a way I was used to hearing.  I looked at my friend, who seemed to realize this at about the same time, and I said, \\\"That's not a squirrel (which is what I had thought it to be at first).\\\" We both rose and turned when suddenly my friend grabbed me and yelled \\\"Look at that!\\\"  I followed his direction and could distinctly see the arm and leg of something tall and hairy standing behind a tree. We both froze in place, too afraid to do anything much.  My friend wanted to run, but I warned him not to.  Eventually, the manimal seemed to just disappear with hardly a sound. Much subdued, we decided to leave and followed the old logging road back out of the area, and my friend told me that he saw a track in the sand at the edge of the creekbed.

There was a owl that would hoot every night. Louder than any owl I have ever heard in my life. We used to joke that it must be as big as a man.  It was also slightly off sounding. Also, it called like this all year long. Not seasonally. 2. Our kids became afraid to sleep in their rooms. They said someone was watching them. They never saw anything, but said they just felt weird. So they slept in our room with us. One night around 2 a.m. we were all woken up by a pounding on our house. Pounding so hard on the other side of the house that our bedroom windows were rattling. My husband yelled and it didn't let up at all. Just a rythmic pounding. Our gun case was in the room closest to the banging. My husband jerked that door open, grabbed his gun and ran outside with a flashlight. There was nothing there. He ran around the house and still didn't see anything. The next day we walked around the house looking for prints of some sort and there were no visible prints. The grass was very thick and lush at the time. Our nearest neighbors were over a mile away. This was about June 2002. 3. We had a momma goat that gave birth to twins. We found her and one baby dead by a pond about a mile from the house. Not much left of either except the hides. We thought it was coyotes or maybe a mountain lion, but even then it seemed unlikely. More like they were carried there. No drag marks anywhere. 4. Our new neighbors and their children came over for dinner. My husband and our neighbor went to check Gates and cattle in a pickup. The kids were playing outside in the yard and the wife and I were talking in the living room with the door open so we could hear the kids. About 45 min before sunset her 13 year old son came up to the house and told us he was scared. His mom asked why and he said he heard something weird in the woods. He was starting to tear up while he was telling us but his mom said oh stop that, go play. And he did. I yelled at the kids and told them to come closer to the house and stood with the door open listening. I thought I heard something off in the distance, but I thought maybe it was a bull and sounded odd because we lived down in a narrow valley. I stayed in the doorway watching the kids and chatting and heard the sound again and told the kids to come on in, because it was kind of creeping me out. I was feeling on alert but still wasn't exactly worried. My husband is a prankster and I thought he was trying to scare me.  By now it's right at sunset and the woods about 100 yards from the house are too dark to see into. I heard the call again and I have never before or again heard a sound like that. By now the kids are freaked out, crying and telling me to come inside, my heart is pounding and I'm thinking- that's not my husband.... The sound started low and slowly went high, I have no idea how long it went on but the thing that made that sound had to have MASSIVE lungs. It wasn't a monotone sound. Almost like there were two sets of vocal cords sounding at the same time. A couple of very low sounds, almost like I could feel them in my chest more than I could hear them, and then it yelled again.  It sounded like the call came from the other side of the creek about 150 yards from the house, directly in front. I was more stunned than scared at this point, but my eyes were watering and I did feel strangely sad suddenly, and I had backed all the way up to the door. Right then the guys came back, from the opposite direction of the calls. We told them what we heard and they listened but heard nothing, grabbed some flashlights and ran down to the creek and followed the creek about a quarter mile but didn't see anything. I didnt hear it again after that but our kids never played outside close to dark after that either. After that we had some stuff moved around or missing. A couple of dogs disappeared and one night it sounded like rythmic tapping on the water pipes in the house in the middle of the night. My husband even crawled under the house to find out what was going on but saw nothing. The next day we saw the pin was pulled on the latch for the well house (by the creek) and the door was standing open. Just odd things like that.

That particular day we had to paint some boundry line around an area near Biern, AR, just southwest of Gurdon, AR. It was in the afternoon and I had already finished \\\"brushing\\\" out the line for the others to paint the dots on the tree. I knew of an old black man that lived in a little shack not far from there. He ALWAYS had an old loggers helmet on, carried an ole filled 22, and only wore blue overalls and a white shirt. After I had finished, I made my way back to the truck which was on a road that was near the railroad tracks. These tracks went through the middle of Biern. As you pull into Biern from hwy 67, you cross these tracks and then turn right for approx. 2 miles. The road then T's and can go to the right to cross the tracks again. In 1984, the road only went about another 1\\\\4 mile before turning back to the right back to 67. Our truck was parked on that last turn that goes back to hwy 67. I had made my way onto the tracks to wait for the others. I wasn't quite a 1\\\\4 mile from where the road crosses over the tracks. The signs that let you know of the tracks are maybe 8 ft. high. When I noticed something on the tracks at that cross-over, I noticed that it \\\"appeared\\\" to be another foot taller. That could have been an optical illusion at that distance. I noticed that I could not see the silver hard hat that the old man always wore, or the white shirt, or the gun. This thing, what ever it might have been stopped on the trakcs and turned. But when it turned, it had to turn the whole upper torso as though it had a stiff neck. It was mostly dark in color, it did have some lighter spots on it. It appeared to take a step towards me when another logging companies truck gun it's motor and startled the creature. It seemed to notice this, turn and take two steps to get into the woods. If you have ever been down the tracks of the railroad, you know that it would be impossible for a normal man to make that kind of distance in only two steps. You have to take into consideration that I was only 18 at the time and still had a pretty vivid imagination. Even with the evidence I had at that time, I questioned what I might have really seen. It wasn't until later that I found out that there have been many sightings of some creature in that part of the woods. A buddy of mine told me that his grandmother lived in that area and had trouble from a two legged creature getting into her garbage at night. He said that there was only one time that the creature came up on her back porch and look into her window. She said that it looked somewhat like a monkey. She never admitted that she was scared because it never threatened her in any way. This story sort of validated mine. This is not the only time that I have seen a creature out int woods.

SHRIEKING MONSTER A horror tale of a 10-foot-tall man led sheriff's deputies last night into a dark brushy area adjoining Peter Pam subdivision, west of Cold Springs. Officers were unable to spot a monster but returned with an equally horrifying report of unidentified shrieking sounds. \\\"There was definitely some creature in the woods,\\\" Deputy William Huntley confirmed. \\\"I've never heard anything like it.\\\"  Huntley's partner, Elbert Miller of Cold Springs, a veteran woodsman, agreed: \\\"I've never heard a sound like that in all my years in the woods.\\\" The search was touched off by an anonymous telephone call to the sheriff's office about 8:30 p.m.  The caller refused to give his name on grounds, \\\"You'll think I'm crazy and put me in a strait jacket.\\\" He reported seeing a man - at least nine or 10 feet tall - in the road by an old gravel pit north of the Peter Pam tract.  Huntley quoted the caller, \\\"It was moving around.  It appeared to be human but was the most awful thing I have ever seen.\\\" Huntley said the caller added, \\\"I'm scared.  I'm an adult and I'm not crazy.  I'm not drunk.  I don't even drink.\\\" Huntley said a second man then came on the phone to confirm the story.  The second man had not seen the monster, Huntley said, but he reported seeing tracks more than 14 inches long. Huntley and Miller then drove to the area.  In first radio dispatches to the Sonora sheriff's office, they reported hearing sounds something like \\\"a human in distress.\\\" \\\"It's heading right towards the car.  Here it comes,\\\" Huntley advised. After a delay, he reported, \\\"Now it seems to be circling the car.  It sounds more and more like an animal of some kind.\\\" But the two officers reported they could see nothing in the heavy brush. \\\"Its definitely not a bear,\\\" Huntley radioed.  \\\"Elbert thinks it's more possibility a mountain lion, but it's not a mountain lion noise.\\\" The two officers shouted at the creature and noticed their shouts did not seem to scare it.  As they attempted to move closer, however, the sound seemed to move away. The officers were forced to head back to Cold Springs when the patrol car's gas supply ran low, but they returned to the spot a short time late and found the unidentified creature still shrieking.  Huntley said they stayed in the area until 1:30 a.m. but were still unable to spot the source of the sounds. The officers returned to the scene after daylight but found nothing to explain the mystery.  \\\"There were no tracks, nothing to indicate anything at all,\\\" Huntley advised.  He noted the area is brushy and rocky and the ground is frozen.

Ruben had the experience and the equipment, but was reluctant, because neither Rios nor Danny had much camping experience, and had never camped in the snow.  But winter camping prevailed, and they ended up on the boarder of Stanislaus National Forest and the west side of Yosemite National Park... a place that was called Carl's Inn, then later renamed Carlon. It is located on the South Fork of the Tuolumne River on Evergreen Road.  The road was open in winter possibly due to the fact that it's on the way to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir. It's not too far, on the map, from Highway 120 and Yosemite's Big Oak Flat Entrance Station.  It is about 4575 feet elevation. Camping is not allowed there anymore, but we still fish there in the spring and summer. Carlon is in a narrow valley, with ridges on both sides, and the road drops quite a bit between the highway and the stream.  The men had gotten off to a late start because of work, so whatever they could pile into Ruben's Jeep in a few minutes is what they took.  After awhile, tt was getting dark and Highway 120 was deserted, they hadn't even seen another car since Buck Meadows. The temperature had dropped and all three agreed to pull over and set up camp at the next level spot, which happened to be an old logging camp road next to a bridge. That's how they found Carlon, it was not their original destination, just a convenient place off the road. Night had come and it was pitch black by the time they parked. They left the Jeep on a 45 degree up-hill angle on the logging road and blocked it's tires with the biggest rocks they could lift. There were no signs that anyone had been there for a long time, no garbage in the empty can or even footprints in the snow. When they realized they had forgotten their firewood they had no choice but to try to find some in the forest. This was no easy task, because snow was on the ground and everything was either wet or frozen. So they ended up \\u201cpruning\\u201d the trees in the national forest... the point being that these three guys were making a lot of noise, tromping around and using their ax, going up the mountain to the top of the ridge, chopping and then dragging tree branches down the mountainside by lantern light. The fire was made in the campsite fire ring with much effort, after siphoning some gas out of the Jeep. They had a good fire going and dinner was ready to be prepared.  Mostly canned foods, like Vienna sausages and Dinty Moore stew set directly into the fire.  Unfortunately, the Dinty Moore stew can exploded and sprayed food all over them and a 13-foot diameter circle around the fire (this is important to what happened later). After eating what was left of dinner, the three fell asleep inside their tent. At about 2:30 or 3:00 a.m., the three campers suddenly awoke to the sound of the crunch-crunch of footsteps (BIG footsteps) in the snow and brush.  Then they heard puffing and snorting and grunting from a creature that sounded like a cross between a gorilla and a pig, and then the blood curdling screams, like \\u201cer er er AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!\\u201d It was coming from the ridge above the campground!  Then more CRUNCH-CRUNCH, CRUNCH-CRUNCH... PUFF, SNORT, GRUNT... \\u201cER ER ERRR AAH-AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!\\u201d  It was walking around the camp along the ridge where they had been earlier that evening getting their illegal wood. The three men froze with fear, the thing was coming closer! They could hear the thing encircling their campsite!!! They knew they were in big trouble! Ruben recalls that it was such a horrible sounding scream it gave him goose bumps all over, but he needed to keep his wits together because the other two where looking to him for answers. He never let on that he was just as scared as they were of whatever it was that was looming over their camp. He also remembers as all this was happening, his mind was racing with the thoughts \\u201cMy God, this thing is going to kill us right here, right now! This is how I am going to die!  When the spring thaw comes someone is going to find the remains of what was left of our camp, shreds of tent material, ripped-up sleeping bags, dented pots and pans, busted-up camping supplies and the dead remains of whatever is left of us.\\u201d Ruben tried to get the other two to be quiet and calm down. He remembered telling them \\u201cWhatever it is out there can hear every sound we are making! Shut up!!!\\u201d One just broke down and cried hysterically, repeating over and over \\u201cWe're going to die! We are going to die! That thing is going to kill us! We're going to die!!\\u201d The other was asking in a freaked-out voice \\u201cWhat is it, Ruben?!?! Let's get out of here! Let\\u2019s go get in the Jeep and get out of here!\\u201d Ruben told them there was no way they'd be able to get the rocks away from the tires fast enough, the thing was so close! And even if they could, driving backwards on black ice could roll the Jeep. Ruben told them they would be better off in the tent and remain quiet and wait to see what would happen next. It screamed that way four separate times, about five to ten minutes in between each scream and was in the campground for about an hour. Ruben had his .22 cal. revolver, but no one would move to see what was out there. They were just waiting for whatever it was to attack their tent. The moon had risen, and they could see the shadows of swaying tree branches through the nylon of the tent. The gun was pointed in the direction of the sounds. Ruben swore that whatever it was out there was going to cast it's shadow down on them with its hairy arms out-stretched, swoop down and yank them out of the tent, tearing everything into shreds! Ruben knew what all the usual forest animals sounded like.  He had been a Boy Scout and a hunter and fisherman for years. He had seen and heard bobcat and cougar and even chased an angry bear, but he had never experienced anything like this before. He just knew that it was heavy and loud and was walking around on two feet!  The crunching and crashing sound was moving along the ridge now, just grunting as it slowly walked away, without screaming anymore. Then it seemed to cross over to the other side of the ridge, very slowly with an occasional fading gorilla-like grunt. The camp was quiet again. The rest of the night the three men took turns staying up, holding the gun and keeping watch inside the tent while the other two tried to sleep. When the sky was just beginning to show signs of daylight, the three grabbed all their gear, threw it into the Jeep and left without breakfast. They didn't see any animal tracks around their camp... and definitely didn't want to go towards the ridge to look for any, either. They were in too much of a hurry to get out of there. They didn't talk about it much on the way home, and they didn't tell anyone why they were home so early that morning. It's been over twenty-six years since it happened, and one of the two guys will not talk about it. He claims that Ruben is crazy and made up the whole story. Ruben says that guy doesn't want to talk about it because he does not want the story getting out that he panicked and was hysterically crying. The other guy still calls Ruben every other Christmas to wish him a good holiday and always ends his conversation with \\u201cRuben, do you think that the thing we heard when we went camping was a Bigfoot?\\u201d Ruben always replies, \\u201cI don't know, we never saw it. It could have been.\\u201d But in my husband's mind and heart he knows it was.\", \"location_details\": \"Take Highway 120 to Evergreen Road to Carlon Station, now a day-use area.\", \"county\": \"Tuolumne County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 7097: Campers hear late night vocalizations at Carlon Station\", \"latitude\": 37.81269, \"longitude\": -119.8609, \"date\": \"1977-01-10\", \"number\": 7097.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9qdz07xfys\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.8609 37.81269)\"}, {\"observed\": \"A witness reported that at around 1:00 a.m., approximately two minutes of extremely loud screaming was heard.

I hesitate because for many years now I've attributed what I saw to an often-active imagination and \\\"trick\\\" of light. Let me explain.  When I was approx. 11 or 12 years old (1978 or '79)I was walking through the woods with my younger brother and friend behind the California Dept of Fish and Game patrol cabin across from the Boulder Flats camp ground, Hwy 108 in Tuolumne County about 50 miles or so east of Sonora.  My father is a retired DFG patrol captain and we'd vacation there several times a year.  All we were doing was walking through the woods several hundred yards from the cabin when we saw what looked like a conical-shaped head, brown in color with deep set eyes peering at us from behind a tree approx.100-120 feet away slightly uphill from where we were standing. That's all.  I still remember that I stood there telling myself that it must be a tree branch stump glinting in the afternoon sun (it was a bright day as I remember).  It didn't move and we stood looking at it for what must have been at least a minute. My brother then became upset and we ran from the area as fast as we could.  I still don't know what I saw and you probably won't find this very interesting but, having read similar accounts of purported sasquatch remaining motinless while observing/ being observed, I have to wonder.\", \"location_details\": \"See above.

We were there for two weeks in our 21' travel trailer, and I was completely bored out of my mind!  I also had just started menstruating for the first time while we were in the middle of our trip  (mentioning this seems weird, but will make sense later). At the campground I met a little girl, a few years younger.  She had been living there with her parents who were without a home.  She showed me a trail that went way out into the woods where there was a small stream (only a few feet wide) with a big rock.  If you climbed up on top of the big rock, there was a tree branch that you could grab onto and swing over the stream.  We played there for a good while and returned to the campground when it started getting dark.  The next day I looked for my friend, but she had apparently moved on with her family - her campsite was empty.  I figured I'd go back out to the stream and play for awhile since I had nothing better to do.  The stream and rock area was a little further than a city block out into the dense forest.  The whole trail was shaded since the pines were so thick.  I merrily went out into the woods, with absolutely no hesitation, looking forward to some fun.  When I got within about 5' to 6' from the big rock I had the strange feeling someone was watching me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up a bit. I still was not afraid and began looking around me (thinking maybe my friend was out there playing somewhere close by and hadn't left as I had thought).  I looked in front of me and slowly turned counter-clockwise peering into the dense woods.  I continued turning until I was looking directly down the small footpath I just walked to the rock.  As I looked at the pathway, I noticed a very large pine tree that was edging the path had a funny looking \\\"arm thing\\\" wrapped around it's middle.  I looked - still not afraid - and was trying to figure out what the heck it was; I could make out long fingers and very dark furry brown hair covering the entire \\\"arm\\\".  I thought to myself \\\"that's not a branch, and it's not a bear's paw, it sure looks like a HAND!\\\"  Now, this tree was approximately 15' from where I was standing, and DIRECTLY next to the pathway I had just come from.  As I continued to look at the \\\"arm\\\" - still not afraid since in my own mind I kept thinking it couldn't POSSIBLY be an arm even though it sure looked exactly like one...I saw a face peek out from the opposite side of the tree and look at me.  It was a very flat face, very dark brown - couldn't make out any features except the eyes, which were looking right at me!  Let me tell you, I was never very athletic, but as soon as we made eye contact I don't think my feet touched the ground!  Worse yet, I had to run right BY IT to get the heck outta there!  I FLEW back to camp and ran into the trailer.  I didn't tell my mom or dad about it since I thought they'd think I was crazy.  Needless to say, I stayed in that trailer for the rest of our vacation at Sugarpine. When I mention I started my period for the first time, I believe animals have an uncanny ability to sense and smell those types of things, maybe it caught wind of me and decided to follow and check me out.  The creature was hunched over a bit, so it's hard to tell exactly how tall it was, or if it was a juvenile.  I do know that the pine tree it had it's arm wrapped around was around 4' wide in circumference - which makes it a pretty long arm!  Another thing to mention is that I don't remember smelling anything.\", \"location_details\": \"The campground has grown quite a bit since 1978-79.

We spent all Saturday building two deer blinds with the intent on coming back to the area to hunt later that year.  The area, at that time, didn't receive very much recreational activity, and we saw no one else while we were camping. Saturday night, three strange incidences occurred.  First, early in the evening, my son and I heard two screams.  The first scream was located near the horse corral.  The scream sounded like it was from something very large.  It was very loud and low-pitched, sort of like a very large angry man.  I have heard mountain lions in the past, since I have hunted all my life, and this was nothing like that.  A few minutes later, we heard another scream, just like the first, but it came from the east, like from the Emigrant Wilderness.  We both acknowledged that we had heard the screams, but neither of us knew what it was.  My son checked the horse corral and didn't see anything. Later that evening, as we were sitting around the campfire, I noticed a pair of red eyes looking at me from near the horse corral.  The area where the eyes were was in total darkness and I do not know if the firelight could reach that far in order to cause the eyes to reflect red.  At first, I just thought it was a deer or other animal, but then it dawned on me that the eyes were at least six to seven feet off the ground.  Since I knew the area very well, I knew that there were no trees or other objects in that area for something, like an owl, to stand on.  After it watched me for about 30 minutes, I asked my son if he also saw it.  He did.  He and I continued to be watched for another 30 minutes (one hour total).  After I briefly looked away and I turned back, the eyes were gone.  The next morning, both my son and I checked the area and confirmed that no trees or other objects were present for an animal to stand on and appear to be seven feet tall. The last incident happened the same night when we went to my camper to eat dinner and go to bed.  The camper was on the bed of my utility truck, and was at least five feet off the ground.  As we were making sandwiches, we both heard and felt a loud bang or thud on the side of the camper (on the front driver's side of the camper).  The camper was hit so hard, it shook the whole truck.  We grabbed our flashlights and immediately went outside, expecting to see either a tree limb or a very dazed deer.  We saw nothing.  We even circled the camper and didn't see anything.  We both then realized that whatever had hit the camper had to be at least five feet tall and could not have been a deer running blindly in the dark.  We thought that all the incidences were strange, but nothing else happened that night and we went home the next day.

The area was about thirty feet across [hard packed red clay], w/ an old shed to the right against some manzanita brush. To the right was a trail through the brush leading to a cabin [unoccupied for years] and unfinished. It was built against the side off a hill where you could walk into it from the trail but when you looked out the window off the main room it was about a forty-foot drop [it was partially on stilts] to the ground.

The account may be somewhat fragmented in presentation, as I want to provide a narrative that portrays the events of the day. Additionally, I prefer to provide a narrative and let people draw there own conclusions. First, I recall finding the remains of a fawn in the meadow I wa surveying. Nothing unusual about that, in-and-of-itself...ties-in later. As I continued to conduct my survey, perhaps thirty minutes or so afterwards, I noticed movement off to my right. What I saw was what appeared to be an animal covered with black, semi-long hair (two to three inches, to guess), walking upright (fully) with a gape somewhat like the current hominids; and approximately five to six feet in height and weighing one hundred seventy-five to two hundred twenty-five pounds.  I saw something move for two or three steps.  It did not appear to go anywhere (but just moved) but of sight.  It did not look at me or react to my viewing, it just simply appeared and then was gone. To some extent I was not really paying attention to my surroundings, as I was focused on my work; but was enjoying the surroundings in that field sort of way.  I recall thinking that that looked like an upright creature walking through the woods.  I tried to repeat my last movements, to see if what I saw was a play on light and shadows.  I was not able to re-create any likeness of what I had seen - the light and shadow of the forest did not seem to be the source of my observation. I did not hear anything.  Either before, during, or after, in regards to the sounds that one might hear if someone were walking in the woods stepping on branches or simply rustling the ground.  I did not take an active interest or pursuit, as I was uncertain of what I think I really saw;  I am skeptical by constitution; not only for mythologies, but in general. Although I did play the event in my mind while I finished my survey.  And occasionally looked in the general vicinity of the area of where I saw the animal-creature-mythological being.  I finished my survey and left the area. While I was returning upstream, approximately one hundred meters from the meadow, I came across an exhausted buck - two or three year old lying on the ground near the creek.  I was able to approach and touch the deer.  I clearly recall brushing flies off his head and sitting next to him for a couple of minutes and thinking this is pretty cool! I was courious about the deer and did think about what I had seen in the meadow. I then proceeded upstream again.  Approximately one hundred fifty meters from the buck I came across a mass of tissue, which looked to me like an aborted fetus.  Upon further investigation, I discovered that it was the entrails of an animal.  Very fresh.  I then looked behind me a saw a freshly killed doe.  Her eyes were still clear and there were no flies or maggots on or in the carcass.  As I examined the doe I could find no sign of struggle. I was unable to locate any apparent method of kill by another animal; thinking of a cougar, which usually will bite at the base of the skull or that general area.  I found no such evidence. The carcass was left fully in the open.  What I did notice was that the right leg had been cleanly ripped off from the main body to include a couple of ribs. There was no blood anywhere.  I looked around as my in-the-woods instincts were quite active. There was that six sense of a presence.  I spent awhile running all of the pieces through my head and thought that this was pretty cool and funky.

To the east was Kennedy canyon which we had hiked up that day, to the west was another canyon of which I don't know the given name, only that it was very deep and rugged. I was a bit concerned about our campsite due to the lack of decent trees to hang our food in (this was before bear cannisters, and packers still hung their food in trees to keep it away from bears), they were all very small due to our elevation.  I awoke about 1 a.m. to the sound of rockfall off one of the peaks above us and I sat awake because I thought it was possibly the sound of a bear coming up the nearby creekbed. Quite suddenly the sound of what I assumed was a large gust of wind came barrelling up the western canyon.  This immedietly struck me as odd as the night was very still.  The sound started as a low moan, growing in strength and intensity and eventually raised in pitch until it resembled a scream bouncing off the mountain walls.  This episode lasted approx. a minute.  As best as I can put the sound into print it went something like this: WHOOOOOOOORROOOOUUUUUIIIIIIEEEEEEEE. I have spent a good part of my life knocking about the wilderness and many years as an alpine mountaineer.  Now I have sat through many a lonley night on a mountain ledge waiting for first light with nothing to do but listen to the wind howl  around the peaks and I've heard it do some pretty strange stuff, but when I heard this noise I was dumbfounded.  Now I was wide awake and all was still again.  No wind whatsoever.  After several minutes the sound began again, building up the canyon until it reached the same screaming crescendo.  I thought \\\"whoa, that was bizarre\\\". Satisfied that our food stash wasn't being raided by a bear I tried to go back to sleep when a very similar moan/howl/scream came up from Kennedy canyon to the east.  The sound was similar in tone and building pitch but seemed fainter, possibly originating from a more distant point.  This is when my girlfriend awoke and I asked her what she thought of the sound, but she wasn't much of a wilderness person and I didn't want to scare her so I didn't push it.\", \"location_details\": \"lat. 38 14' 34\\\" long. 119 36' 49\\\" intersection of Kennedy canyon trail and what I call \\\"Leavitt lake trail\\\".

Our location was Eagle Meadows which is above Strawberry, California off of California Highway 108. It was a sunny, cold day.  We dressed in our camoflauge and began our hunt.  We were deep in the woods had climbed down a hillside of boulders and into what looked like a perfect hunting area.  Forest on either side of a meadow approximately 300 yards wide. We found pine trees to sit under (they had low branches) to await our perfect buck and so put on our skunk scent. My husband was approximately 10 feet away from me.  We each had views across the meadow.  But I could not share his nor could he share my view for there was a clump of trees and bushes about 100 yards in front of us and positioned between the trees we were under.   About 20 minutes into the hunt we heard branches breaking across the meadow.  My husband quietly told me to be aware of bears.  To stay alert.  It was approximately 10:30/11:00 a.m. when I looked back across the meadow and saw something that wasn't there 3 to 5 minutes ago.  Immediately, I thought \\\"Could it be a Bear?\\\"  I rationalized if it was only shadows from trees, a dead log with light coming through?  But none of my theories fit. The image I saw was black.  The sun was shining from behind it so the front looked black.  Then I thought \\\"It must be a Sasquatch.\\\"  I saw most of his head, 3/4's of his chest area and down to what could possibly be the waist.  The rest was hidden by the trees/bushes.  After totally analyzing the figure, the blackness, I thought if it is a bigboot it must have eyes.  I brought my small camouflage binoculars up to my eyes slowly and looked across this meadow.  It was then that fear and anxiousness prevailed.  For I saw two yellow eyes watching me very intently.  I have never been so scared.  I was afraid to move an inch.  I continued observing for about 15 minutes and he stood there and watched me too.  We were both very still.  I was wondering if he would move, why he was so intent on observing me?  Then my instinct told me to move and get out of there.  I motioned to my husband that I was going back to camp but did not tell him why.  My fear didn't allow me to speak.  My intent was to leave the area as quickly as possible. I high-tailed it back to camp.  Up the stoney hillside and through the woods all the time looking over my shoulder.  Later when my husband came in I asked him if he saw anything unusual?  He said he didn't.  So the Bigfoot didn't walk across the meadow or my husband would have seen him.   The Sasquatch found me.  I was there under that tree first, minutes before he came into the area.  I honestly believe without a doubt that this was a Sasquatch.  I do not believe that it was a dangerous threat to me or it would have advanced towards me.  I do not believe it was a bear because a bear would not have stood still for so long.  I wonder if these creatures are just as about us as we are of them.  If only I could go back to that point in time.  I would have slowly moved across the meadow towards it, to see what it would have done and to investigate farther.   My husband said, \\\"What would you have done if it charged you?\\\"  I said, \\\"Run and scream.\\\"  My point is, how will anyone ever know the truth if they don't cautiously and tamely approach one.  Would love the opportunity to go on a real sighting and/or search.  The opportunity to see a Sasqatch in motion would be awesome.\", \"location_details\": \"We were located in Eagle Meadows.

We had been on the road sometime and were still responsive but tired. As we passed a tight hairpin turn we had not said anything for hours because of the monotonous trip.

I am the first to admit I am no expert but here is the description. My wife noticed the eyes as reflextive, I did not. I noted the eyes of the creature as black melting into the darkness of it's face. The creature was standing on a rock, balancing very well as if to have a bend in the middle of it's foot. The rock it stood on tapered to an almost 90 degree angle. When I first saw the creature it was bent over directly facing us. As we came around the corner it very very slowly and methodically pivotted in an upright standing motion as its head looked directly up at us. I will never forget it. It had a black coat with a silvery gray. It appearred \\\"old\\\" and my wife afterward felt similar. The chest and torso were almost cylindrical. The arms extended far, alittle below the pelvis and looked long and cylindrical and thin. The most amazing thing about this creature was the stealthy survivalist mode. It mimiced the actions of nature. What I mean to say is instead of for instance a human seeing an oncoming car and displaying a startled response by moving irratically and uncontrolled. The creature was very deliberate, meticulous in it's actions moving no more than the branches around it trying not to attract attention. It went from a bent over position to standing upright. \", \"location_details\": \"Approx. 2-5 miles after the upper river campsite at the first sharp 90 degree turn.\", \"county\": \"Tuolumne County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 3672: Late night sighting by motorists travelling through Tioga Pass (Yosemite), a few miles beyond Crane Flat Campground\", \"latitude\": 37.91111, \"longitude\": -119.2569, \"date\": \"1998-08-01\", \"number\": 3672.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qepwjxb0z\", \"temperature_high\": 71.16, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": 34.03, \"humidity\": 0.39, \"cloud_cover\": 0.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.29, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 12.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 120.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.72, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.2569 37.91111)\"}, {\"observed\": \"During the last week of August, 1999, myself and a friend left the Kennedy trailhead about an hour before dark.

An obvious trail crosses the road in the same location, so the area is staked out.  Although no bigfoot is seen, something very large and walking on two feet approaches the stakeout location.  A sudden oncoming car scares whatever it was downhill and a large, two legged creatures is heard crashing through the brush. May 13, 2001:  all the broken trees, two nests, and dozens of footprints (14 inches, 5.5 foot stride, trees broken at the 6 to 6.5 foot level) are documented.  One nest was \\\"incomplete\\\" and obviously not used recently, but the other was very unique.

The hair stood up on my neck when I read this due to the similarities with my experience. My experience occurred the same month and year at the Clark Fork campground, about one mile Southwest of Sand Flat. My wife and I arrived at the Clark Fork campground on Thursday, September 20th 2001. This was our first ever September camping trip (we usually go in mid-August). We were surprised at how few people were in the campground compared to our 4 previous trips to this area. One factor that probably lead to the extremely low occupancy was that the 9/11 terrorist attacks had happened the week before. Out of 88 camp sites, probably only twelve were occupied. We set up our camp in the \\u201cB loop\\u201d and settled in. The B loop is our favorite of the 2 campground loops. It has a slightly nicer setting (more pine trees, nicer bathrooms, etc.) and is closer to the \\u201cwilderness\\u201d than the A loop. But on Sunday the 23rd, the two retiree campground hosts told us the B loop was closing for the season and that we would need to move to the A loop of we were going to stay. After relocating to the A loop on Sunday morning we noticed that there was only two other campsites occupied. All other campers had left. One group was a young couple with two very young children, the other was two older men in their 60\\u2019s or 70\\u2019s with a trailer. I had never seen so few people in this area. It was really nice to practically have the whole place to ourselves. It was very quiet. Sunday night it rained hard, and we spent most of Monday morning patching our leaky tent and drying everything out. On Monday night, we did as we always did before bed: played cards and listened to the radio. We climbed into our tent and went to bed at about 10:00 p.m. Late that night after 2 a.m., I slowly came out of a deep sleep due to high-pitch noise which I initially thought was a wounded coyote. After I was fully awake, the noise got much louder. It was clearly a \\u201cscreaming\\u201d sound rather than howling, yipping, yelling, or shouting. The screaming appeared to be coming from the Clark Fork River area, north of the access road which leads to the campground. The sound got progressively louder and was obviously not from a canine. I wondered if any human being could make a sound so loud, long, and hideous. The sound changed pitch and tempo many times. My wife woke up about a minute into the screaming. She asked, \\u201cWhy is that man screaming?\\u201d I had no idea what could have made such a sound but it was very unsettling. My wife said it sounded like a man was being murdered out in the forest, but then commented that a person couldn\\u2019t make a sound like that. Whatever made these sounds had to have an enormous lung capacity. The screaming went on for about 5 full minutes before it stopped. I laid awake for a while, nervous and wondering what it could have been. Frankly I didn\\u2019t want to know. As I drifted off to sleep about an hour later, I was awakened by a very loud metal-on-metal \\u201cbang\\u201d coming from the closed B loop portion of the campground. It was obvious to me that the sound was one of the bear-proof dumpster lids being lifted up and then dropped. I\\u2019ve heard the sound many times. Now that\\u2019s fine and dandy, except that it was 3:00 a.m., bears can\\u2019t open the dumpster lids, and there was no one else in the area where the sound came from. The B loop was closed. This really bothered me. I did not fall asleep until almost dawn. I laid clutching a pistol with my heart racing every time I heard a rustle outside of our tent. I refused to leave the tent until it was light. I have heard hundreds of coyotes throughout the years, both in the Sierras and in the California desert, and this screaming was not a coyote. As for the possibility of a mountain lion making these sounds, I would bet my life that it wasn\\u2019t a feline. I\\u2019ve heard mountain lions make some strange noises, but the bottom line is that a cat sounds like a cat. It\\u2019s easy to distinguish between noises a feline, a canine, or a bear makes. The screaming that my wife and I heard was none of these.\", \"location_details\": \"Popular area off Highway 108 corridor.

I was hiking around when my friend came to look for me.  We hiked further into the forest and found a big rock formation and climbed up.  The top was about the size of a football field.  On top we found three stacked rocks and took some video of it.  The bottom rock was big, it came up to my shins and the top two were smaller. Maybe five pounds each.

Just my imagination I thought, so we hiked on.  This feeling remained and I started to think about how long it would take to get up the rocks we were clibing down. Besides if something was watching us it could have been a bear.  I convinced my friend to go back to camp and we did. At about 8:30 or 9:00 my friend heard rocks being clinked together of in the distance and he said they were answered off in the opposite direction.  I didn't believe him but soon I heard the clinking too.  It was fast but obviously not a wood pecker.  My friend commented that the pattern seemed not human, but I thought it could have been. This banging went on for about twenty minutes and then quit.  We went to sleep later and didn't hear anything all night.  I did notice it was a moonless night and the forest was pitch black.  The next morning we got up and I checked for foot prints around the camp fire were I cleared everything within five feet but saw nothing.  As we were packing up we heard the banging off in the distance again so I decided to try and copy the patterns.  I tried using two rocks and the sound wouldn't carry.  So I then tried a rock on a log.  Finally I settled on a small branch on the log because it sounded to me like what was coming from the forest.  The banging was repititious with a pattern on the end.  I mimiced the banging for about ten minutes before it stopped answering me.  I started packing up again and we heard it another time so I tried to answer it.  No answer.  It did it again, I answered, no answer.  There were long pauses in between my responces and its banging.  I got the feeling what ever it was, wanted to continue it's banging but not in response to me.  We finished packing up and left.\", \"location_details\": \"Take Highway 108, past Strawberry to the Trail of the Gargoyles.\", \"county\": \"Tuolumne County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 4650: Campers find stacked rocks and hear unusual rock banging near Strawberry\", \"latitude\": 38.24805, \"longitude\": -119.9924, \"date\": \"2002-07-04\", \"number\": 4650.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9qf9tdb5n3\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.81, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 126.0, \"wind_speed\": 5.08, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.9924 38.24805)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I was traveling with my father and my fathers friends. Now i should tell you that my father was an active hunter, hiker and outdoorsman. My father was also 6'3 and two hundred and fifty pounds. There where exactly 6 of us including my self. We had traveled to the end of forest route 3n83 and had planned to camp in the general area for the night. Later on my father and told me that all this was planned so i could get used to hunting, and camping, this was a surprise for my 13th birthday. he said that we were supposed to spend two days there. We began to travel east of the end of the road. We walked for about 20 minutes through moderatley dense underbrush and reached a clearing where my dad decided to teach me how to make a fire. After around two hours i finally succeeded in making a fire. At around 4:30pm I finally made a fire. At this time my father decided to camp here, his friends agreed and set about setting up camp. Now as they set up they talked about there other hunting experiances, me being young and stupid i decided to re-enact some of the stories. I decided to walk in a general east direction playing with a stick pretending it was a rifle. I eventually got to a smaller clearing and saw a squirell or some other small mammal and decided to chase it. It ran across the clearing and up the nearest tree. I threw two rocks at it and then became bored. So i continued in the direction i was headed. I came to an area where the tress thinned and i could see a meadow. At this time it had just begun to get dark. I turned around to go back to the camp when I noticed a terrible odor. It smelled like a very large wallowy pig. I covered my nose and continued walking. I began hearing brush breaking about 50 -100 feet behind me. At this time i noticed that me father and his friends had begun to look for me and I could hear them calling. As soon as i could hear the voices the brush breaking stopped so i ran back to the camp. When i got back to where they were they had already started to pass around beef jerky and water. I sat next to my father and awaited the food. That night i was in a tent with my father who was sound asleep, when i thought i heard some brush breaking. We had divided our group into three tents, two in each. I sat there very still not sure what to do but i felt that something was wrong. I quietly woke up my dad to tell him about the sound. He woke up and I motioned him to be quiet and he heard the brush breaking around the edge of our camp. He grabbed his hand gun, and yelled whos there? The brush breaking stopped and then the area got quiet. My dad cocked the safety back and yelled again. This time there was a kind of crashing noise like a branch snapping, and then it got quiet. My dad crept form the tent and checked on the others, they were woken up by my dads yelling and had heard the crash. They lit a fire and remained awake the rest of the night. The food we had hung 6 feet to 7 1/2 feet of the ground was gone. The branch it was on had broken about a foot's length from the trunk of the tree, the branch there was at least 4 to 6 inches in diameter.  There was also the faint wallowy odor in the forest around the clearing. We packed our stuff up and left the woods.

This area is deep in the Sierra Mountains and has plenty of snow during the winter months. We stayed at our friends\\u2019 cabin, which sleeps twelve people with no problem. The cabin is about six to eight feet off the ground and the only way in is by using wooden stairs to climb into it. There was plenty of snow and we were warned about walking on the porch. To get to the porch we had to go through the house.  The cabin was warm with the great wooden heater even though the windows had no coverings. Christmas Eve was upon us and the traditional events came and went.  After midnight, everyone eventually went to bed and retired for the night.  I was sleeping in a room by the porch and the windows like I said before, had no curtains or shades. I could see very little from all the windows except for one, which was near the outside porch light.  I could see a small portion of the porch from that window.  I went to sleep as did everyone else, but was awakened several hours later.  There was a slight movement all around the cabin like a small earthquake.  I turned over thinking just that. Moments later, I felt movement again but this time it felt like someone was walking on the porch.  I sat up to look around and did not see anything or anyone. I decided to use the restroom since I was awake and eventually found my way back to bed.  It was then that I noticed something moving by the porch light. At first, I thought it was a man with long brown hair, but then noticed that it had hair on its arms and back. After a better look, it had hair all over its body, but it seemed more of an orange-brown color.  Frightened as can be, I just kept looking at this thing.  It had its back towards me for several minutes and then slowly turned to look in my direction.  I was about twenty feet from the window so I am certain that it did not see me.  It leaned over to see through the window.  I would estimate it to have been about six foot six inches tall.  Its weight was about three hundred pounds and well proportioned.  I compared  compared the beast to a friend who is six foot two inches tall and weights three hundred pounds.  It looked fairly young like a teenage boy. There was also no odor as this thing walked around.  The face was more like a caveman but very sad looking.  I could barely see its eyes in the dark, but I noticed them when it looked left and right. They seemed to be dark brown. The beast was frightening when it turned and looked in towards the window.  Its chest was like that of a male and I am assuming that it was not quite a grownup yet.  It was searching for something but I don\\u2019t know what.  I also noticed that our friend\\u2019s dogs were no where to be heard or found in the cabin. After a quick scan of the room, it turned and headed towards the porch rail.  Eventually, it jumped from the porch, which was a six to eight foot drop.  In the morning, I did not mention this event to anyone nor did I go looking for evidence. I believe there are different species scattered around the world.  I always believe they existed but my thoughts were reinforced with this citing.

It's a hard 23 minute, offroad drive of 4.3 miles, so we were very specific about our departure and return times, just in case my husband would need to come looking for us. After unsuccessfully looking for a wading spot near our truck, (mucky water, underwater plants and drop-offs) the boys and I made quite a trek to a prior favorite point that juts out like a partial island, with fishing nets, swimsuits and snacks. The path has become almost non-existent due to fallen trees, branches and almost no foot traffic. This is a very remote lake, not visible from any main forest service road. Our whole trip consisted of 1 1/3 hours at the lake. We were dipping our toes and talking about the fish, when I said we needed to pack it up. I had just heard a noise in the far distance of what sounded like a single, medium tone \\\"whoop or yup\\\" (#1). I told the boys to be quiet for a minute and this time we all heard it (#2). None of us could identify it, so I yelled, \\\"Hello?\\\" and waited. It responded again with a single \\\"whoop\\\" (#3) which sounded significantly louder.  The boys caught on to this right away, and said, \\u201cMom, it\\u2019s getting closer\\u201d.  We thought it might be a hurt backpacker off in the distance, so I yelled, \\\"Is anybody out there?\\\" Each response was about 30-60 seconds and this time it was very loud and close (#4). I thought someone was playing a joke on us at first, but realized I could neither see, nor identify the sound. The frightening issue was that no other sound was made as it approached us. I expected sticks and twigs to be snapping, so I wrote it off as some curious bird moving quickly between trees (mostly for the boys sake).  There was a golden mantel chipmunk in the distance that was very upset about something, but everything else was eerily quiet. I felt like we were being watched the whole time, but never said anything because I didn't want to spook the boys.  I experienced the same \\\"watched\\\" feeling the last time we were at that spot (last year) and remember hearing what I thought was a deer walking around us, but I never saw anything. We packed up fast and bee-lined it to the pickup. I did not want to be stuck on a spit of land with two young kids that are just learning to swim. I could have made it across the lake to the truck, but not the boys. It sounded like a cross between a human and animal that was made by something very large. It was absolutely not a bird (quail/woodpecker), bear or cougar sound. Last year on two separate occasions, we had a young cougar, then a bear run in front of our pickup and we're very familiar with their \\\"walking and verbal\\\"  sounds. I have been camping all of my life and have never experienced that sound before. I had my digital camera with me and never once thought to put it in Video mode to record the sounds. The whole thing took place over a 5 minute period and we were just focusing on getting back to the pickup. I was born and raised in Port Orchard, WA, so I'm very familiar with Sasquatch and BigFoot tales. I have always felt they could be real, but have never had any encounter with one. I decided to poke around online to see what a Yeti might sound like and read John Bindernagel's research. My hair stood on end and I called my husband at work who thinks the whole thing is fabulous. I also read about the BFRO expeditions in Northern California and Humboldt County, along with a lot of other information and projects. I decided to respond to you with my information for whatever it\\u2019s worth.  I can\\u2019t explain it, and both of the boys have very vivid and accurate memories of what we all heard.

I cannot say that any of the recordings sounded just like what we heard, however it sounded similar to many of them. My family (husband and two kids) went up to Big Prather Meadows, straight up from Dorrington, California. My husband's grandpa has a small cabin in the meadow, and we go there when we can, generally in the summer. I made the mistake of reading a bunch of your stuff prior to the trip, and I admit that I was on \\\"high alert\\\" that first night. However, around 2:30 or so in the morning of Friday, July 25th, 2008 (just three days ago), I heard some kind of vocalization that was not familiar to me. I was not happy to hear this, honestly. I suppose I ought to be since I have held an avid interest in this subject for years, but there is a whacking big difference between sitting safely in your home reading about this stuff on the net, and listening to something make funky noises in the dark woods of a forest. As my best friend said, \\\"I used to really like the cabin...\\\" I got out of the tent to wake up my husband, who was sleeping on the ground by the unused fire pit. We both sat and listened to the sounds for about an hour and a half, or so. To the best of my ability, this is what we heard: Loud, clear, not-shrill sounding (to me, the Puyallup calls sound somewhat metallic and shrill), medium-range, and smooth sounds. They began lower in pitch and would rise smoothly to end at a higher pitch, but not like the whoops that you have recorded. These didn't have that \\\"lilt\\\" at the end. It was just a smooth ascent from low range up to a higher range. There was another call that sounded like what a contraction looks like. (Forgive me, I'm not sure how to describe it but it made me think of what my contractions looked like on paper when birthing my kids), beginning low, smoothly rising up to a higher level, and then smoothly descending down again. There was also a kind of a hiccup sort of sound that would directly follow some of the calls, but I was literally shaking and too freaked out about it to really pay attention to what kind of call it followed: the upswing, or the contraction call. Anyhow, as I said, this went on for over an hour with the two of us listening. Sometimes it would sound like it was moving near to us. Other times it sounded further away. I am not sure if there were two animals, thus accounting for the near/far sounds, or one. If it was two animals, they sounded identical to me. After this happened, we both tried to explain how big/far the sounds were to us. We both agree that it sounded somewhat distant, but find it hard to tell since sound might carry really well in a dead-silent forest. We agree that it sounded to be between a half a mile and a mile away. We also agree that it was a large sound. Whatever made it sounded effortless on its part, but was a very large sound. We believe that it is a sound of \\\"size\\\" similar to, say a very loud moo of a cow across a field. I'm digging here because I've never had any experience like it so I don't have much I can truly compare it to. I grew up in Washington State, west side. I'm a Biology minor with a Life Science teaching credential, so I am familiar, at least, with what wildlife looks like and sounds like in videos, if not in person. But most of my personal encounters with wildlife have been animals of the smaller variety: coyote yips and howls things like that. I've only heard larger animals on wildlife programs and I am holding out the hope that one of your specialists will call me back and explain that what we heard was just a \\\"such and such\\\" and often is confused with a Big Foot call. I'd be able to enjoy the cabin a lot more if you could do so. But, I know you won't, because this was a very strange sound, and even my mathematician-husband, who is grounded in science and wasn't afraid like I was, stated that it sure was loud, and that it wasn't like anything he'd ever heard before. It sounded like an animal, but it also sounded enough like a person to think it could have been a joke, but not exactly.

On our trip home we decided to stop by the Grand Canyon in Arizona because she had never seen it. We got there pretty late in the afternoon and we stayed to view the sunset over the canyon. We departed for Flagstaff soon after it had gotten dark. We headed down a less traveled stretch of road as a short cut. I do admit that I don't remember the highway number, but I will look it up. The road had next to no traffic on it and my friend and I took advantage of the time to talk. The highway was very curvy and we had just come out of a turn into a fairly long straight away when we noticed something walking down the right side of the road on the shoulder. Note the rest of this took place in amatter of a few short minutes although it seemed like an hour. What we saw was walking upright like a man, but was noticibly larger. As we got closer my girlfriend said \\\"is that a bear?\\\" It was at that moment that it became visible that our companion on the road was covered head to toe in brown to light-brown fur (hair). It was also at that moment that I realized what we were looking at. I had seen enough TV and heard enough hunting stories from my dad. I stopped the car. Our headlights now shown into the area that the bigfoot could see them and it stopped as well. We were about 50 yards apart at this point maybe closer. It then turned to face us. I'll never forget this moment it is burned into my memory. At first the animal turned it's head slightly to look back, but it's head seemed to be attached at the chest so it had to turn completly to face us. We didn't make a sound. We were in complete shock. Our friend was about seven feet tall and was covered head to toe in hair. The body was somewhat without definition as in I didn't make out features like hips or gender. The arms seemed to be abnormally long...maybe to just above the knee. The face was mostly hairless and looked...well without something else to compare it to kinda like a charactor from Planet of the Apes. Not exactly, but this creature deffinatly was from the ape family with just a touch of human looks. The eyes seemed to glow a bit green like a cat or dog in the headlights. It stood there for a matter of seconds and I could tell that it was thinking about it's next move. It ran it's tongue across the front of it's upper teeth in pondurance. It took one small step in our direction. My girlfriend went bizerk. She screamed in horror. It stopped it's forward movement, looked around, and headed into the woods near the road in a couple of strides. We never got another look at it. My girlfriend quickly got it together and wanted out of the area. I agreed. We took of and i made a wide turn around the area that the Bigfoot had once stood. I never got the feeling that it ment us any harm, but was very curious about what we were. You couldn't convince my girlfriend of that though. The event shocked here for life and she refused to ever talk about it again. To this day I'm sure she has blocked it out. I on the other hand will never forget it. It did take me years before I could tell my wife about my encounter.

We were there for 4 nights and 5 days. At the end of each day just as the sun was behind the ridge but not quite down we started hearing a high pitched whoop sound. The sound came as a double whoop(whoop,whoop). It was a little higher pitched and shorter. It could be heard from the ridge just west of our campsite about a 1/2 mile or so away. The sound continued for about 2-3 hours or until just after dark. It also sounded as if it was moving around on the ridge and maybe even coming closer as it got louder several times. there was about 30-40 seconds in between each set of whoops. On the second night the sounds started again just like clock work from the same area on the ridge but this time they were answered by another on the ridge just to our southeast. the second sound was alot closer and it would return or answer the one from the west about 1-2 seconds after it would sound. this went on the rest of our trip only from dusk to dark each night. On one of the evenings there was a third whoop that answered in from the north but it seemed farther away and only answered every 15-20 minutes. This made me remember how my father had been hunting in this same spot about 4 years prior and told me how his cab over camper was rocked several times in the night.

I didn't check for footprints or observe any movement on the slope that might have indicated what animal was producing the noise.  We were driving back to Utah from Phoenix after attending the funeral of an old family friend.  The only people in the car were my 10 year old son and I.  My son has a fascination with science and more particularly earth sciences so I decided to show him the volcanic craters around Sunset Crater north of Flagstaff, Arizona and also to see the ancient ruins of Wapatki National Monument which is on the same road that breaks off of highway 89 and then rejoins it several miles north.  We drove past the turnoff for the campground west of Sunset Crater and then stopped on the road that cuts into the northern slope of Sunset Crater right where a ridge of lava juts out of the ground (on the northern side of the road from the slope of the volcano) like a frozen lava fountain.  This lava ridge is the beginning of the Bonito Lava field that extends north-northwest of Sunset Crater.  I parked the Montero against the slope since there wasn't enough room for a road shoulder and several cars passed during the incident.  My son wanted to climb the lava ridge and I stayed at the base using the camcorder to film him.  While walking to the ridge I kept hearing a very heavy, breathy huffing noise coming from the slope of Sunset Crater slightly southwest of our position and above us on the slope.  It would repeat every five to ten seconds and I caught my son, on video, standing on the top of the lava ridge, looking back at the slope where the noise was originating, pointing at the location and saying \\\"I think I heard something up there\\\" and I responded \\\"I did too, I don't know what it is\\\" and my son replied \\\"I think we must get out of here\\\" and I responded by kind of nervously chuckling it off and continuing to film.  I was a bit uneasy since it sounded like a very large animal and I was unarmed in defense of my only son. Unfortunately in reviewing the video, I can't hear the huffing but it sounded like an animal that was passing a large volume of air in an angry huffing (I have had several bear encounters and none of them ever sounded like this) that didn't want us there but didn't seem to want to draw too much attention to itself (my speculation) since there were several people in the campsite/turnout around the bend of the road west of our position that probably couldn't hear this noise.  It sounded quite capable of making much more noise than it was doing.  Walking back to the car I tried to imitate this noise out load without success but the noise from the slope ceased with my attempt.  The pine trees in the area and on the slope obscured my view of the animal though it obviously knew we were there because we made no attempt to mute our voices and my son's excitement for being there showed in his voice.

We got our fire started about 7:00 pm because it was getting really chilly about an hour later we were talking away just shooting the breeze when We heard something from a distance I turned to my boyfriend and I said shh, listen and sure enough clear as day the most sharp clear screams just came over the wilderness as if it was so clear. We counted them and finally they ended at 12 being the last scream count. The final two of the screams sounded most horrible from the other 10 you can immediately hear the difference it was as if in pain a painful scream. That was it for me to scare me half out mf my witts begging my boyfriend to please explain to me what the hell that was as if he could give me an answer, but all he could say is I have no idea. It seemed as if it were a distance away east of us the steep canyons I am sure carry sound further then it really is but I would estimate it at being 1 to 2miles away all I know is it was clear and carried through the woods. what in the wordl would have a pair of lungs like that? If I had to choose animal or human animal would be off and human no way not that scream in the niddle of no where. Now, I know that they're are plenty of animals in the wild and I know they all have their own distinct sound, but this was unlike any animal I have heard.. we went down the list of known animals that inhabit the Arizona wilderness and as we marked each one off it became more clear to us that was neither animal, bear, mountain lion, elk buggle sheesh even havelina,which are only in the more lower elevations and in more desert terrain. nope, there is no way. When we came back from our trip it was all we could talk about there and all the way home.

Monday night, Memorial Day PM, at 7:30 I went for a walk heading east on FR 124 to maybe see some elk before dark. I went at least 1/4 mile and heard a coyote sound off. I stopped to listen and a whole chorus of coyotes joined in for about 4 seconds and stopped as quickly as they started. I would guess they were 1/4 to 1/2 mile southeast of me. A second or so after that I heard an \\\"AH,OO\\\" just as distant or even further away in the same direction. I thought someone was calling back to the coyotes but what an odd sound for a person to make, then there was another just the same as the first. I turned back to camp and wondered about these two calls as I walked  I didn\\u2019t stop to listen again as it was getting dark and I wanted to get back to camp. At 8:15 I was back and I sat outside our trailer to listen again. Just I sat down I heart the \\\"AH,OO\\\" again from the same direction  followed by a high pitch \\\"WOW\\\" sound then another and then one more \\\"AH,OO\\\". So there were four \\\"AH,OO\\\" and two \\\"WOW\\\" sounds all together, that I heard anyway. The \\\"AH,OO\\\" was a mid pitch for a male person, The AH was about 1 1/2 seconds with OO short and slightly lower pitch. The WOW was very high pitch and lasted about 3 seconds. Both of these calls just started and ended without fading in or out and without waver. I listen until 9 PM without any more calls then went in to sleep. The calls were not real loud, if I was walking on the gravel road rather than stopped I might have missed them, but they were bit enough to carry over the sound of the breeze in the trees which was coming from the west. I was hesitant to report this since it was just sounds, but , rather odd sounds for a person or any animal I know of.

It sounded like animals fighting.  There are many wild animal species in the forest where I live including racoons, skunks, foxes, and elk, but also domestic animals like dogs and cats.  I assumed the noise was coming from some of these animals.  After I sat up in my bed, the noise stopped.  I lay back down, and after several minutes I heard some very peculiar noises.  First, there was a series of \\\"whoops\\\" that sounded like a cross between a monkey's whoop and a whistle.  They seemed to be coming from different locations within about a 50 foot radius.  They were neither particularly loud, nor soft.  It sounded to me like 2 or 3 individuals.  Trying to come up with a rational candidate for the type of animal, I imagined it might be some sort of large migratory bird.  This is when I heard the second type of sound, something like a pig grunting but different.  It seemed as if there were articulation in the grunting.  It is difficult to describe, but it made my blood run cold.  The grunting seemed to come from only one animal, and was clearly audible.  This went on for perhaps a minute.  The area was then illuminated by a passing car and all sounds immediatley ceased.  Several minutes later I heard a loud \\\"crack\\\" from a large branch being broken in the woods at the edge of my yard.  I did not get out of bed or attempt to look outside as I was still quite frankly scared from the creepy nature of the grunting.

It was August, but the monsoon season was in full effect and it was a cool day for Arizona.  I hiked up slope from FR 151 towards the Snowbowl Ski Resort.  The area has springs and so the plant diversity is high and the wildflowers were at their peak.  Being a cloudy, cool day I kept an eye out for wildlife which would normaly bed down at midday in August, though I did not see anything other than various songbirds and raptors. I had been in the area maybe two hours but as I like to wander around slowly (I see more that way) rather than \\\"hike\\\" from point A to point B at a quick pace, I had not covered much ground in that time.  I was at the edge of an aspen grove when I heard a loud howling from up slope and a little to the east of me in the direction of the ski resort.  My first thought was that it was a foreign tourist goofing off. Because Snowbowl has a paved road to it and the views are awesome, tourists from all over the world on their way to the Grand Canyon stop at Snowbowl and many hike around as it is a beautiful and inviting area.  So I thought I was hearing a human.  But I wasn't so sure after the next howl- I was really puzzled.  The sound seemed somewhat human-like and the volume, though  quite loud, wasn't too extraordinary- I could possibly howl that loud, though it would be hard to do without real strain and the sounds I heard were almost casual- no hint of any strain.  But it seemed to be an unusually weird sound for a human to make.  Almost as if the human had a deformation of some kind which distorted the sound.  This was why I thought of a \\\"foreign\\\" tourist first, because of the weirdness of the sound. I heard about a half dozen calls and it was clear that whatever was making the sounds was coming in my general direction at a rapid pace.  By this time, I was sure it was not a human but a large animal. I was at the edge of a clearing and I waited at that spot expecting to see whatever was making the calls.  The first howl was maybe 250 meters away and the final one maybe 75-100 meters away.  Then it stopped and I never did see anything.  I did not hear it moving through the woods and did not notice any smells.  It is possible that whatever it was smelled me as the air was gently moving up slope towards the animal.  I think it probable that this was the reason whatever it was stopped moving towards me and vocalizing. I waited a minute or so after the final vocalization and then I went up slope in the general direction I had last heard it but did not see anything or any indication of a human or animal.  My curiosity was at a peak and so I made a real effort to find whatever it was and spent another hour circling the area looking for signs of a large animal passing through. I have listened to the recordings on this site and I did not make a match between the sounds- though there were some similarities between what I heard and the calls from Washington State and the 'Ohio Howls'.  What I heard was not nearly as drawn out and evenly toned as the Ohio recording, but was similar.  A deep to mid-range 'howl' with a little variation in the tone somewhat similar to the Snohomish recording.  Each call lasted maybe 3-4 seconds and was seperated by various lengths of time from maybe 5 seconds to maybe 15 seconds.  Some of the recordings on this site, if I heard in the field, I might describe as having a 'monkey' quality to them- distinctly animal-like.  The Ohio recording does not really have that quality and neither did the sounds that I heard.  At the time I only thought of a human at first and then I was merely puzzled and could not classify what I had heard. I have thought about this incident since it occurred trying to put some explanation to it.  I do not think it was a human for a couple of reasons:  The sound, though it had a somewhat human-like quality, was not at all the type of sound a human would (or perhaps, could) make to communicate to another- say two or more people in the woods who are separated and walking along and vocally maintaining contact with one another. The volume of the sound would have required real effort for a human to achieve and I couldn't imagine a human being able to howl like that and walk around a mountain at that elevation at the same time- and it was traveling fast.  Nor did it have any element of humor about it if it was just some high spirited tourist having fun.  And there was only one caller, not two or more people hootin and hollering to each other.  The call was somewhat somber in tone and there was no hint of excitement or emotion about it.  Also, a human walking through those woods would have made a great deal of noise and I would have heard or seen a human when I went looking after the last vocalization.  I did not see any humans during that day though I went right to the base of the ski resort and could see the parking lot. At the time, the sounds did not spook me and I never got that unexplained adrenaline rush and surge of fear that I have gotten on more than one occasion in the wilderness or ocean.  I am quite familiar with the wildlife in this area and have heard and seen just about everything except a mountain lion. It certainly was not an elk, bobcat, coyote, dog, or cougar.  It might just possibly have been a bear-  I have had several close encounters with bears and have heard their vocalizations.  But bears do not, to my knowledge, vocalize in such a regular, loud way.  Because I heard 6 or 7 howls, I had time to really hear the sound and think about it.  To me it sounded most like an ape, though I only thought of this much later. What I heard was not much of an incident. I puzzled over it for a long time.  I am reporting it here because a sasquatch is the best possible answer that I can come up with, though I did not come to that conclusion until months after the incident.  So I did a web search on bigfoot and found this site and the recordings.  Another puzzling thing though- if it was a sasquatch, that area is quite popular with people and when I go there, I usually do see someone else.  That area could be easily avoided by an animal.  Despite the abundance of wildlife as a potential food source, why would a sasquatch travel through this area at midday in the summer , howling?  The whole incident is weird...\", \"location_details\": \"This happened just below the Arizona Snowbowl in Hart Prairie on the San Francisco Peaks.

We did have significant storms in the area that day but late in the afternoon things began to clear up and we decided to head to one of our favorite spots for sunset photography.  This was at the Arizona Snowbowl lower parking lot.  The area from the parking lot to the west starts with a large lush green meadow before falling away into forest, meadows, and rolling hills (cinder cones)that stretch from Hart Prarie some 80 miles to the Grand Canyon.  We set up our cameras anticipating a beautiful sunset and great opportunities to take pictures.  there were a number of people in the parking lot area (10-15). A minute later two hikers started from the parking lot down through the meadow and I remember hoping that they wouldn't be standing in that meadow when I wanted to take a photo. As they traversed the meadow and passed out of sight we heard a single coyote sound off in their general vicinity. As the sun sank towards the horizon and we were getting ready to start taking pictures the two hikers came back from out of the woods and up through the meadow nearly to the parking lot. At that moment we heard a scream from the forest several hundred yards below us.  There were people in the parking lot and two motorcycles idling right next to us.  The scream was so loud that not only did we hear it well but one guy on a motorcylce looked at his companion (with motorcycles running and helmets on) and said \\\"did you hear that-what the hell was that ?\\\" We know that most people in that parking lot heard this scream. As the sun was now setting in a glorious fashion with thunderstorms around and off into the distance we got busy taking pictures.  As the sun set and twilight began to overtake things most of the parking lot had emptied out except a pickup load of people had just showed up and they were half drunk and wandering around making noise.  It was getting close to dark and once again we heard this scream from the same general area of the forest below us.  The people from the truck said - \\\" what the heck was that - a mountain lion ?\\\" and began to laugh and talk nervously - I just wanted to say to them \\\"please shut up\\\" since if any other noises were made they would have been difficult to hear above their drunken mumbling and laughing. Finally they left - it was now dark, we hung around for a bit but not long and heard nothing more.  This was not a mountain lion scream or anything else we could even begin to identify.  It sounded somewhat like a scream a human could make but the distance it was travelling was significant.  It started kind of low and built up.  To us it sounded like the voices of 15 people all starting at the same split second and roaring the exact same note.

In fact, some weekends we may not see anyone at all, but most of the time maybe at most a couple of other campers riding ATVs or something. Two weekends ago we were at a fairly remote campsite.  We were pretty closed in by the trees. It wasn't a large open space like many campsites there.  It had been raining on and off most of the day, and we spent the day reading and napping. I was sitting in the front seat of our conversion van reading while hubby was back on the bed napping.  I started hearing what sounded like an animal ripping bark from a tree and moving around in the dense growth.  This went on for about 15 to 20 minutes.  I was so sure there was an elk or other large animal nearby that I sat my book aside, grabbed my camera and waited.  It was absolutely silent (besides a few snores from the back of the van) that I was hoping whatever it was out there would break the clearing and I'd get a great photo.  After about ten minutes of silence and no other movement I went back to my book, figuring whatever it was had smelled us and moved on. Not five minutes after I had put my camera down and resumed reading a branch about 4 feet long and 3 to 4 inches round came shooting out of the trees directly at the van like a javelin.  It hit the side mirror dead on center, pushing it in towards the van. (It is hard to even move this mirror by hand. The force it took to force it in towards the van had to be tremendous).  The force was such that it shattered the side mirror into many pieces.  There's still a dent on the back metal portion of the mirror from the impact. I had glanced up just a second or two before impact, whether it was from noticing movement in front of me or just glancing up by chance, I don't know.  I saw the trajectory, and it was NOT a limb FALLING from a tree. It came straight at us, like I said before like a javelin being hurled at us. I jumped over the front seat into the back and [my husband] woke up immediately. He saw what happened while I was babbling away like an idiot.  His first words were, \\\"Somebody threw that at us? Who was it?\\\"  We listened and watched for a while but didn't hear anything else.  A while later I did think I heard movement in the forest, but by that time my senses were so alert I wasn't sure of what I was hearing.  This happened in the mid-afternoon on Saturday, July 12, 2008. The incident rattled me and that night I had a restless night sleeping.  We usually sleep in the back of the conversion van with all the slider windows open and other windows popped out but the front two windows rolled up.  I have no idea what time it was, but I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of something sniffing at the small slider window by my feet.  Whatever it was, it was very LARGE.  It was taking deep, deep breaths like it was smelling inside of the van and then -- for lack of a better description -- sort of huffing/grunting out the breath.  Each breath in sounded was deep and long. . .much longer than a human can do it.  The only way I can think of to describe the breath out is like when a horse sometimes exhales and blows its lips together to make that sound.  It wasn't exactly that, but similar enough to use it as a vague description. I laid there frozen, barely breathing, my heart absolutely pounding out of my chest.  I kept poking at my husband trying to get him to wake up, but he didn't.  I didn't want to say anything, I don't know why, I guess because I didn't want whatever it was to know I was awake.  It was pitch black but I could sense it was large and aware of what it was doing.  This smelling went on for a few minutes, of course it seemed like forever but was probably less than five.  I was laying on back back and vaguely glanced a moving shape in the driver's side mirror but that's it.  Weird thing is, I never heard it move away at all and it seemed like I laid there for a long time after the smelling stopped.  Maybe I'm attributing things to something that I shouldn't, but I sensed a bit of curiosity in the creature by the way it was smelling at the window.  Although I didn't feel entirely safe, I didn't feel extremely threatened either, or not enough to force my husband awake. When we woke up in the morning the first thing we noticed is that the kitchen had been raided ... but very politely, neatly raided.  It wasn't destroyed at all like it would be if it was a bear or a coyote or an elk or even a bird.  We had a packet of biscuits in aluminum foil that had been what seemed like very carefully opened and all the biscuits removed and missing.  Not a crumb left like it would be if an animal would have gotten into them and eaten them on the spot.  Out of all the stuff on the table, that was all that was taken.  Also something had gotten in the trash and removed only one thing. . .a Jimmy Dean sausage container.  It was laying a few feet away near the edge of the clearing.  Only something with a lot of dexterity could have opened that aluminum foil without ripping or tearing it at all. We talked about this incident all week and went over what it could have possibly been, then decided to go back this weekend.  We discussed the possibility of a \\\"Big Foot\\\", not knowing what in the world else could have done all this, been so precise, so aware.  I've lived in Arizona my whole life and never even knew there had been Big Foot sightings here until we linked to your website through Google Earth. To link this all together, we decided to go back this weekend to the same spot.  While we personally had nothing occur at our campsite on this weekend (July 19, 2008), both our husband and I heard sounds in the late afternoon very similar to the recordings on your website. It was Saturday afternoon and some people down the road a ways started shooting.  Target practice, I assume, since it's not hunting season.  All of a sudden we heard these horrible screams echoing through the woods.  Like I said, they were very similar to the first three recordings on your website, only much angrier.  We heard the sounds approximately three or four times, each incident in conjunction with the shooting.  Each time it started, the howling/screaming/raging sound started.  We have both spent a lot of time outdoors in Arizona and neither of us has ever heard anything like it.  What ever it was, was very, very loud and long. The lung capacity was amazing.  The sounds were spread out over approximately a 30 minute period.\", \"location_details\": \"[Editor's note: Directions will be kept confidential, the campers plan to return to this location.]\", \"county\": \"Coconino County\", \"state\": \"Arizona\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 24218.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"My brother, Sister, Nephew, my daughter, and I were on our 08 archery hunt in the Kaibab national forest on the North side of the Grand Canyon. We camped down the road from where our family had a prior experience that was reported under incident #13964. On Friday night at about 9 pm my sister and I walked down the road from camp and made several vocalizations including a howl and several whoops to try and ilicit a response. After trying for about 30 minutes without any return calls we walked back to camp. When we arrived my sister took my daughter and nephew and went into the camp trailer to put them to bed. Just as they got into the trailer the excitement began. My brother and I were sitting around the camp fire talking when we heard what sounded like a large branch being broked off of a tree violently with a loud crash or something stepping on a large branch and breaking it. It was so loud that it caught both of our attentions. We acted nonchalant about what occurred and just tried to listen for anything else and talked. For the next 30 minutes or so we listened as the camp was circled by two separate unseen things. They were not being very stealthy and were actually very loud and destructive as far the trees the were hiding in. The one would pace from the north west side of camp to almost passed the north towards east and the other paced back and forth behind the camp trailer that was behind us. Sometimes we would here what sounded like a smaller tree being shaken, or heavy foot steps inside the tall grass. We could tell that there were two of them as some times we could hear both at the same time doing different things. Then the rocks and sticks started being thrown. The first the two of us heard was a stick thrown on top of a tarp being used for shade next to the trailer. then we heard almost a continous volley of small rocks and sticks being thrown at different points around the camp site. The largest rock that was thrown landed on the ground between us and the camp trailer. It was the size of a softball and when it hit the thud sound it made scared us both. Soon after this we both lost our nerve and decided to go into the camp trailer where there was more cover between us and them. When we got into the trailer my sister and nephew were still awake and told us they could hear everything we heard from inside. My sister added though that she could hear what sounded like foot steps behind the trailer the whole time and she said at one point she heard a loud heavy sigh. She also described hearing branches being broken behind the trailer and either rocks or small twigs being thrown at the camp trailer. My nephew verified her account and we all tried to go to sleep. Shortly after turning off the lights we all heard a loud metallic thud. Just outside the door of the camp trailer was a sheet metal box with food in it on a small table. The noise sounded like either something had knocked on the box or threw something hard at it. We all fell asleep quickly except for my brother who could not sleep. He stated for a good time later he continued to hear things being thrown at the camp trailer. He eventually did fall asleep but was awoken some time in the early morning to what he described as a branch object being being drug across the canvas top of the trailer over his head. Whatever it was it passed from one side of the trailer to the other. The next day was uneventful as we did not try to make any calls. My nephew had made himself sick he was so nervous from the night before. We also had rain that night and another hunting group had moved in about a mile down the road. on Sunday night my sister and I again went off down the road to try making calls. This time we went off down the opposite side. We repeated our attempts that we made on Friday and still had no response. We returned to camp and sat around the fire for about 30 minutes without any incident. We then went to bed. During the night as we slept something approached the campt trailer and shook it violently at least 6 times spread out throughout the night. I can say it was not the wind as the trailer did not sway to one side from being blown but it felt like something grabbed the side of the trailer and twisted it from side to side in both directions very violently. All of the three adults felt this go on throughout the night. My brother also described that at about 1200 midnight he heard a low growl that lasted about 10 seconds. He described it as subtle but strong as he could feel the vibrations produced by the sound and he said it felt like it was shaking him slightly. The next morning we left to go home. During the weekend we checked the camp trying to find sign or prints. The ground around the camp was covered with a thick layer of oak leaves and pine needles. The only thing we found were the small 3-4 inch sticks and small rocks that were used to pelt our trailer.\", \"location_details\": \"We were camped east of Crazy Jug Point near Big Saddle.\", \"county\": \"Coconino County\", \"state\": \"Arizona\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 24659.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"On Saturday 09-13-08 around 2am in the morning in the Kaibab which is located in Arizona.

A few months later, a friend had a nearly identical incident at the same location which made me reconsider.  As a mechanical engineer, I am trained in the hard sciences and as such, I am a scientist.  I really don\\u2019t believe in something unless there is hard evidence or the scientific community is in agreement.  Since the incident and my friend\\u2019s incident I have been doing a lot of research and feel that there is substantial evidence that a forest primate exists in North America.  As a scientist, my previous position was that something could exist but there was not enough evidence to prove it.  I do admit that I have always had an interest in the bigfoot phenomenon and knew some things about it like wood knocking, howls, etc.  I also took a natural anthropology class in college.  My teacher was one of the most famous anthropologist of our time and I learned well about all of the primates, the australopithecines , early hominids and of course gigantopithicus. My point is that I am an intelligent person who had an informed skeptical position concerning the bigfoot phenomenon but has come to believe that the forests are inhabited by either an early hominid or a great ape, or something in between.  I am known for my situational memory and feel that my remembrance of the incident has not diminished.  I have told my story many times and every time I get goose bumps.  It was Aug of 2010.  My wife, brother, father-in-law and I were camping on the Mogollon Rim.  We were in my favorite spot in a remote location of the Apache Sitgreaves Forest that I had been frequenting for about two years.  We were not doing any particular activities like shooting or hunting, we were not riding quads or anything.  It was a two night camping weekend for us and for the most part we were just hiking and relaxing and observing elk.  The oddest thing about this weekend was that there was almost nobody in this area of the forest, a lot of people avoid camping during the monsoon although this weekend was basically dry.  The closest campsite was about 2 miles away.  It was occupied by two older couples whom I had spoke to earlier that day of the incident.  The other notable observation was that it was a pitch black, moonless night in which it must have been overcast because I could only see about 3 to 5 feet.  In retrospect, I cannot imagine these two elderly couples creeping 2 miles into my camp, on foot, without lights, just to disturb us in our sleep.  Also, Arizonans are known for their gun toting, it is never wise to approach someone\\u2019s camp unannounced especially in the middle of a pitch black night. I have been an outdoorsman since I can remember and am an accomplished hunter. I am familiar with the Arizona fauna and the sounds they make.  At about 12 AM, I was awoken to the sound of two sticks cracking together near my RV trailer.  The knocking sounded as if somebody had two girthy sticks, maybe about 2 inches in diameter, and they were banging them together at a perfect 2 second interval.  Sometimes the sticks sounded a little different as if a knot had been struck but the timing was never flawed.  Now a lot of people say \\u201cwell that could be an elk\\u2019s antlers or some bird cracking his beak\\u201d, but I have never heard a known animal make this sound, let alone in perfect repetition for the duration that I heard it.  But that wasn\\u2019t the strangest part; the sound was translating through the forest quickly and without making additional sounds.  The sound was emanating from an area on the backside of my trailer and receding away.  It would then come closer and recede again.  This was happening over and over.  I would say that it was probably about 20 to 30 yards at the closest and went out an additional 50 to 70 yards away.  My campsite was near a primitive road and the sound seemed to parallel the road but I can\\u2019t be sure. After lying in bed, listening to this for about 2 minutes, I decided that I needed to do something about this thing that was disturbing my camp.  Familiar with the observance that bigfoots knocked wood, a bigfoot did come to mind instantly, but I felt that as the patriarch, I needed to investigate and protect my family. My family members were all three asleep and I believe there may have been some snoring going on which may have given the creature some comfort to continue doing this.  I was sleeping in my underwear and decided to get dressed.  I got dressed more quietly than ever before or since and I am certain that I made no sound that the creature could hear.  I did not turn on any lights and was absolutely silent, feeling around for my clothes, shoes and pistol. Once dressed, I moved silently to the trailer door, being careful not to shake the trailer or create any noises.  This was actually quite easy because there is a door adjacent to my bed.  I waited until the cracking sound had receded as far away as it sounded like it was going to get.  And remember, the sound was emanating from the opposite side of my trailer.  I slowly opened the door, again careful not to make a noise.  The knocking sound continued. This is the part that freaks me out the most: as soon as I stepped outside, the knocking sound that seemed as far away from me as possible, stopped.  Now perhaps the trailer made a creaking sound when I put my weight on the metal step but I had the distinct feeling that something, another creature, had seen me get out of the trailer.  For some reason the door opening did not cause the sound to stop but when I got out, whatever was creating that cracking sound decided to stop even though it was 70 or 100 yards away.  I had the feeling that if something saw me, it would be beyond the rear of my trailer; the door that I just opened would have blocked the view of me from the front of the trailer.  A position to the rear would have nicely triangulated a view of me and of the wood knocking creature.  In short, I got the distinct impression that there was a second creature serving as lookout. Now the story does not stop there, I had a lousy flashlight (unlit) in one hand and my pistol in the other.  I proceeded around the front of my trailer to the other side.  Once I was on the other side, I was confronted by the pitch black woods in which I was certain that there were a couple of unknown creatures.  Having the distinct feeling that there was something to the rear of my trailer, I shinned the lousy flashlight directly towards the rear.  This only lit up the two very large pine trees that were about twelve feet in front of me.  Shining the flashlight did however elicit a response.  As soon as I shown the light, directly in front of me, but on the other side of the trees, perhaps about 20 to 40 yards away, something let out a \\u201cwhoop, whoop\\u201d.  It was clear, it was distinct and it was amazing.  Before this incident, I had never heard on TV that bigfoot made a \\u201cwhoop, whoop\\u201d sound, so I am certain that this was not in my head.  At that moment, I knew that there was something different from an elk, a bear, an owl, etc that was disturbing my camp.  And I also knew that there was more than one.  I felt that this was an alert call signaling any additional creatures to leave the area. During my time outside of the trailer, I was conscious of the observances that bigfoot is supposed to smell.  I specifically sniffed the air trying to get an indication of a bad smell but never smelled anything.  It was a temperate night, the air was a bit cool, probably in the low 60\\u2019s but I didn\\u2019t smell anything. Right after the \\u201cwhoop, whoop\\u201d, my wife began to stir, turning on lights and going to the restroom.  I went back around the front of the trailer near the door I exited from and my wife was standing there asking me what was going on.  I told her that \\u201cthere is something out here, I don\\u2019t know what it is, but there is something out here.\\u201d  Surprisingly, maybe because I knew they were scared away, I was able to fall asleep shortly thereafter.  My wife told me that before she went back to sleep that she heard a couple of knocks too.  Of, course I had told her what I had heard and it may have been fresh on her mind as she started to fall asleep.  She did wake me to tell me, but I didn\\u2019t hear anything and we both fell asleep.  My brother and father -in-law never really woke up during the incident.  I would say the incident lasted about 10 minutes from the moment I first woke up until the \\u201cwhoop, whoop\\u201d was heard. The next day, I searched the road and any sandy areas in the area for footprints.  I am an experienced animal tracker but found no tracks.  As we discussed the event I grabbed two ponderosa pine branches that I thought approximated what I heard.  I cracked them together and it sounded fairly similar.  I experimented with different sizes and materials (oak, aspen and pine).  I felt like 2 inch diameter pine sticks with the bark removed sounded closest to what I had heard. The last week of November that same year, my friend, his dad and brother were staying in my exact same campsite hunting elk.  My friend heard the 2 second wood knocking rhythm translating through the woods just like I had for quite a few minutes.  I believe his dad and brother did not really stir.  He did not go out to confront it and it eventually stopped.\", \"location_details\": \"I do not wish to divulge the exact location.\", \"county\": \"Coconino County\", \"state\": \"Arizona\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 32251.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"It was in the middle of the night and I took my three kids camping.

We took our two small dogs with us. I thought if we went during the week there wouldn't be many people there and I was right. We set up camp in the rain at about 2pm. It rained till about 6pm we saw no one just these big trucks going back in forth on the road till about 5pm. It was very dark and we were trying to start a fire but everything was wet and all we had was a dull ax to chop wood. I believe we were being very noise hacking at the dead wood we were trying to cut to size for our fire. After we got the fire going we cook our dinner and ate. It was very quiet no sound at all then we saw a large full moon rising from the east it lit up the sky. We decided to go to bed around 10pm I put some more wood on the camp fire hoping it would burn all night. As we were in our tent the moon was like a big night light then we fell asleep. At about 3:10am I woke up to a sound that was unlike anything I have ever heard both our dogs sat up and were very still. It was like as if someone was screaming thru a loud PA system it was very clear. I woke my wife so she could hear the sound but it had stop then again it started we were both laying there trying to figure out what could be large in size that would make a sound so loud and long it was echoing in the canyon to the north of us. Then it stop it must of lasted about 5 to 10 min at the most. We stayed in our tent for about a 1/2hr but we both needed to GO if you know what I mean. So we put our shoes on I grab my wife's 9mm and we stepped out of our tent we could see all around us because of the full moon light. After taking care of business we went back into our tent and went to bed. I wont lie it was hard to me to fall asleep. The next morning after breakfast I took one of our dogs out for a walk in the direction the screams came from and saw nothing but about 200yard in the same direction I found what looked to be a possible shelter made from dead trees about 12 to 15 feet long and 4 to 5\\\" in diameter. they were set up standing like a teepee there was one tree laying on the ground next to the structure I tried to lift it and found it was so heavy that I don't think two large men could pick it up much less stand it up like the rest. One other thing I saw was the trees were saw cut but there were no tree stumps around so the trees had to be carried there from else where. If someone did this for fun they had to work hard to do this and I cant see why. The first night we were there no one was camping any where near us but the second day we were there some campers set up about 1/2 mile to the north on the other side of the canyon. That night our dogs were on edge looking out away from camp and growling my wife said she could hear something large moving around in the woods to the west of us but when shining a spot light in that direction she didn't see anything. I put some more wood on our fire then we went to bed.

We were escaping the heat of Phoenix and it was a beautiful day, clear, sunny and no rain or clouds. That night we were asleep in the cabin but I kept waking up because I was on a very uncomfortable cot.  As I lay there trying to fall asleep again, I heard what sounded like a \\u201cwhoop\\u201d.  This was followed by a clear wood knock sound.  They were about 8-10 seconds apart.  I lay there listening and about 1 minute later, I heard the same \\u201cwhoop\\u201d and again, followed up by another knock about 10 seconds later.   They seemed to both come from the same direction (SE of the cabin).  I was the only one who heard it as the kids were asleep and I didn\\u2019t tell them as I didn\\u2019t want to spook them.   The sounds sounded close, I\\u2019m guessing within 50 yards since I was able to hear them while inside the cabin. There are a few other things that make this significant and eerie. One was that from the time we arrived at the cabin, there was no wildlife or sounds. Just birds chirping and the occasional wind blowing through the pine trees.  We never heard a crack in the woods or any other wildlife sound. It was just quiet. So when I heard this, it stood out because we heard nothing all afternoon, evening or at night.  Another is that as we drove down the road to the cabin we saw only 2-3 other camping parties along the roughly 12 mile stretch to get to the cabin.  It was Sunday afternoon about 2PM when we drove to the cabin.  But when we left the next morning about 7AM, they had all left \\u2013 assumedly the previous afternoon since it was a Sunday.  So we were the only ones in the area 12 miles back in the woods.  We passed one truck near the main road as we left Monday morning but that was it. Lastly was another noise we heard that I didn\\u2019t put much credence in until after I heard the whoops.  It was about 10:30 earlier that night, shortly after we climbed in bed. I was trying to fall asleep while the two kids were playing games on their ipods.  All of a sudden a rap noise hit the window on the south side of the cabin.  Immediately, the kids look at me and say \\u201cwhat was that?!\\u201d The sound was like a small pebble hitting the window.  Again, it was clear and no wind.  I played it off to the kids that it was probably just a moth or bug hitting the window and it may have been just that.  But then I heard the whoop and knocks later in the night and wondered if something was watching us. Whenever we camp, we always set up a camera trap for the fun of it to see what wanders in to the camp. I did so on this night too and it was set up in front of the cabin but it had zero hits on it.  Not sure what all this adds up to.  The thing hitting the window could have just been a bug.

I was camped in a developed USFS campground (CG) on the Coconino National Forest in central Arizona in the Mogollon Rim area. The CG is situated in an canyon within a mixed forest of spruce, fir, oak, aspen, and mainly Ponderosa pine. The cliff edge of the Rim is about 3/4 mile South of the CG. I was sitting in the shade and had just finished reading a work of fiction by James Patterson which had a strange ending. I was musing about the ending and just looking West across the CG when a very fast moving dark figure crossed the CG heading from North to South. My first thought was of a large kid on a bicycle as it was moving so fast on the in camp gravel road. But its' travel path was counter to the road. Then I realized what it was that I had seen. It was a very large Bigfoot. The sighting only lasted about three seconds and I was very lucky to have seen it at all. It crossed the CG in a shaded area and blended well into its' background but the meadow beyond it to the West was bathed in afternoon Sunlight and backlit the dark figure. It was about 125 yards from my viewpoint so facial detail was not clear. It ran with a slight forward cant to its' body. I noted that the head did not bob up and down like a human runners head at speed. The coat was almost black looking but with the back lighting I noticed a slight reddish tint to the figures profile as it passed by. I had not noticed its legs or arm movement. Later, I went over to where the figure had crossed. On the North side of the drainage area, there was an area of crushed grass near the beginning of the travel path. Then the figure had moved South across the in camp road and had gone into a depression in the high grass. There were other areas of crushed grass along its' suspected travel path. Also a crushed fern near the split rail fence that bordered the CG where I suspect it had stepped over, crossed the forest road, and went into thick timber. I believe the Earth depression and a row of large logs obscurred my view of its'legs as it passed by. I had only seen its' torso from the hips up but did note that the figure did not appear to have much of a neck, if any. The torso was very thick and I guessed it was a least twice the thickness of a human. It was a once in a lifetime event and as I said, I was very lucky to have seen the Sasquatch at all.

Way before I joined the Church, my young wife and I worked for a private school at the end of the road near French Gulch CA. This is on the edge of the Trinity Mountains (Big Foot Country), and about 25 miles into the woods, behind Clair Engle Lake. It was pretty isolated. Once in awhile log trucks would go by, but mostly no one used the road to come there or go past. I was assigned midnight bed checks, and had to walk through the entire compound. This was a former ranch: the main house and girls cabins on one side, along with the Teacher's and staff cabins and trailer, and across the creek, and up the pasture alongside the woods, the boy's line of cabins. To cross the creek, I could either wade or ford, where the cars crossed, or walk past the cook house, that sat next to the creek and cross over on a suspension bridge, that was about jeep wide. We used it only for walking. I sometimes waded because bears would come raid the trash cans, and that was a bother to get past them sometimes. It was a bit crisp that night, so I decided to walk the bridge, cross the pasture, and walkup the half mile or so along the cabins, to check each one. My boots made a hollow thumping noise as I crossed, and the bridge began to sway like it always did, with a side to side motion, as well as a rolling wave to the deck. The water was about 5 feet below me, and only filled about 10 feet across the bottom. The edges of the creek, about 20 feet per side, were dry and exposed rocks and boulders. The creek was about 2 feet deep and swirled softly, chuckling between and over the rocks. There was no moon, but there was sufficient starlight, to see, once I had walked from my trailer, to the bridge, about a quarter mile. A single yard light was on up at the owner's house, but none down at my end of the headquarters compound. I walked up to each cabin, and checked them all. Everyone was asleep, no deer were in the pasture, and the one horse we had, was up at the top end of the pasture, snorting at me, and pawing the ground. That was not unusual, so I just headed back to the bottom of the hill toward the bridge. The stars were bright, and the sky was black. As I approached the bridge, I thought I could hear something near the trash cans on the creek side of the cook house. Something was snuffling around and then banging trash can lids onto the ground. \\\"Crap,\\\" I thought, \\\"Bears. I could hear whatever it was knocking over the cans, and rooting around in them. I was a bit frustrated, since the day guy was supposed to have taken them to town, that afternoon, to dump them to avoid just this sort of thing. I picked up a couple of large smooth river rocks, and stepped onto the bridge. This bridge is about 60 feet long, a suspension bridge, about 15 feet wide. The cables are too high, except in the middle to touch, to use as a hand rail, then too low in the middle to use for that either. The planks are 3\\\" thick, 10 inches wide, very heavy, and heavily oiled. They made a deep thump when trod upon. I stepped quietly onto the bridge, and drew back my arm. The animal had stopped, and with a whiff, dropped the can it was exploring with a crash. I threw the river rock as hard as I could, and it thumped down, just under the eaves of the building, and rolled into a can, Wham! I peered into the darkness, and shadow under the eaves of the cook shack, but could not see anything but a darker shadow, where I though this animal was. The animal gave out another \\\"Woof,\\\" like a bear would when he is trying to sniff something out. As it stood, I realized, that although I couldn't see much, I could tell that a head and shoulders had risen about the edge of the eaves. \\\"Wow!\\\" My head was trying to compute, \\\"animal on top of a trash can, or a big animal on the ground, that eave is at least 8 feet from the ground...\\\" It wasn't making sense, but the moment didn't last long. With a rumble deep in its chest it began moving out into the open, toward the end of the bridge. I by now was almost to the middle, so I started backing up, and got to about 1/4th of the way from the end. I started hollering at it, and chucked the other two rocks I had with me, one landing at his feet, and the other hitting somewhere near his hip.  He came up out of a crouch, and stood erect. He was just shorter than the bridge uprights, and they were ten feet tall! \\\"Oh, crap\\\", I thought. As he walked forward, the gait was more like a big man, than any bear I had ever seen. Only he was far bigger than any man I had ever seen either. Its legs where long, and this was NO BEAR! Now here you are going to have to trust me. I have hunted all my life, and I am no city boy. I know a bear when I see one, and I had no reason to expect anything else here. I began shouting at it, as I backed up. He stepped onto the bridge, and in two steps was over the free-swinging portion. The bridge sagged, and I jumped up and down, stomping my feet, and shouting. I backed to the ground, and bent to pick up some more rocks. I stepped forward, pounded on the bridge, and threw another rock; saying \\\"Hey, get!\\\" As the rock sailed I thought that I was using some puny weapons. I also realized my voice was pretty weak. I was scared **itless! I threw two more rocks in quick succession, and they bounced on the deck, and flew off into the dark, one splashing into the creek. He dodged them handily. His eyes glowed in the dark, and he took a step closer. I started jumping up and down, and getting the bridge to moving sideways and up and down. I had a hold of one of the upright cables, and I had the bridge going pretty good. The animal held onto the cables, above his head, and then with one hand, he vaulted the cables, and disappeared below the bridge. I thought he was headed my way under the bridge, and I jumped back off and grabbed a two handed rock, to smash his face or whatever I could. I realized I could hear him splashing in the creek, and peered into the darkness, and saw the form running upstream into the back country. I stood a second, heart pounding, and realized there was a foul stench in the air, as a slight breeze carried his scent from that side of the bridge. It smelled of dead animals, and rotten food, and funky bad feet and armpits. I made my way across the bridge, across the compound, hefting the two handed rock, and eventually got to my trailer. No lights had come on in any of the cabins, or at the owner's house, and no one had come to help me. I slid open the glass door, stepped inside, and slid it back, and leaned against the wall. My wife was in back reading, with a small light on. She looked at me and asked me what was wrong. I don't know what that was, I won't argue for Bigfoot, nor any other animal. I know it was not a bear. I know what that looks like.\", \"location_details\": \"From Hwy. 299, & then up the French Gultch Rd.\", \"county\": \"Shasta County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 26381: Man recalls adversarial encounter with an unknown creature near French Gulch\", \"latitude\": 40.8333, \"longitude\": -122.6417, \"date\": \"1973-04-15\", \"number\": 26381.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9r2b31rp1q\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": 44.3, \"humidity\": 0.81, \"cloud_cover\": 0.77, \"moon_phase\": 0.44, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 148.0, \"wind_speed\": 5.77, \"location\": \"POINT(-122.6417 40.8333)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My family and I went to lake Shasta CA.

After awhile, my sister wanted to go out to the dock to be with my older sister, so I put her on my shoulders and started walking.  About 1/4 mile half way out I started hearing something walking in the woods. I stopped, it stopped. I started, it started. So I kept walking. I dropped my sister off and started heading back.  A little way in and I started hearing the footsteps again. Now they were closer and I could see something in the shadows. As I kept walking, it kept getting closer. I stopped again and all of a sudden, it came crashing through the brush straight for me. I just stood there, looking at it then it stopped about 5 feet from me and I could plainly see what was standing there, but I couldn\\u2019t believe what I was seeing.

We had just moved to California from Colorado and didn't know anywhere to hike so we drove to a Ranger Station in Shasta Lake. We bought a map and although it was the 4th of July weekend we asked the rangers if there was anyplace we could go that would be isolated or not too crowded. We got a fire permit because we were planning to 4 wheel somewhere remote and then hike to a camp area. We were told to drive on a logging road next to squaw creek and were shown some turns to take to end up past the last campground on Squaw creek. We drove until we spotted a stream leading up to a meadow about 200 yards from the road. We crossed a deep creek with our camping gear and helped our dog cross because the water was swift enough to make swimming across difficult. We set up our tent and decided to follow the creek to see if fishing might be good. We were surprised by an abandoned beaver dam and the pond was full of fish. I wanted to hike a bit further and my wife wanted to finish some reading so she went back to camp with the dog. I continued hiking until I heard something following me. When I stopped it stopped. I suspected I was being followed by a couger so I made lots of noise by stepping on branches and acting like I wasn't afraid of anything. I still stopped from time to time to look toward the area of the noise and had my knife ready along with a big stick that I purposely hit against rocks and trees to make myself appear aggressive. Finally I got back to camp and my wife asked me what was going on. I didn't want to scare her so I said it was getting dark and had to get some firewood. She said the dog had been growling and looking in the direction from which I had come. I still didn't say anything mainly because I wasn't afraid because I had packed a gun with plenty of ammo. I had been hunting and in the woods all my life. I figured a fire would keep the lion away along with our talking and laughing, plus we had a big husky dog that was a good protector. When I got back to camp with some wood my wife informed me that the dog must have taked a poop around the camp site because it stunk. It did smell but I was unable to find anything to get rid of. We lit a fire and cooked then settled back to let the fire burn out. When the fire got low we were terrified by the sound of breaking branches and a sound unlike anything I have ever heard in my life. I screamed to my wife to throw more wood on the fire and rushed to the tent to get my gun. I was bowled over first by my wife then the dog. I got the gun and yelled to my wife to get the flashlights. We threw more wood on the fire and heard something retreat. At this point I got my composure back and we shined our very bright lights into the woods hoping to pick out a pair of eyes. When I didn't see any I was alamed because I thought all animals eyes glowed in the dark as they reflected light. I was thinking that there must be a man out there trying to scare us. So I yelled for whoever was out there to identify himself because I has a gun and was prepared to shoot if I heard another noise. Now I had to tell my wife what had happened on my hike and what I still assume is correct about animals eyes. We talked about going back to the bronco and leaving but decided it was too risky to walk 200 yards through the woods and then have to cross the steam in the dark where we could easily step in a hole and lose the gun or be at a big disadvantage. We decided to burn a big fire all night and stay awake. As frightened as we were I talked my wife into getting some sleep on my lap and I would stay awake. She fell asleep and then so did I. We were startled awake by the dog growling and something rushing toward us through the trees. We threw more wood on the fire and screamed into the woods that we were ready to shoot. Again a retreat as the fire got bigger. Now we were definitly awake for the rest of the night. The next morning we packed up and left. When we got down to the stream I remembered my axe shovel and saw were still at the camp so I went back for them. I was greeted by a horrible smell, but that was it so I grabbed my things and ran down the hill. When I got close to the stream I slowed down and started walking. My wife informed me that right after I left the dog was growling and looking in the direction that I had taken. Since this incident we now camp in designated campsites that have other campers. We always used to 4 wheel or hike to places to camp that were completly isolated. We never considered bigfoot until I told my story to a new friend and he mentioned that the situation was similar to bigfoot related incidents.\", \"location_details\": \"Road by Squaw Creek about 2 to 4 miles past the last camp ground.

We had put our houseboat to shore in a secluded cove that branched off of the main lake.  I went on a walk alone along the shore, and then followed a near-dry creek bed that came down out of the nearby woods to the lake.  I had followed the creek bed for about a mile when I came upon two sets of footprints in the mud along the creek bed.  Both looked human-like, with five-toes.  One set was about a size 14, the other about a size 9, comparing them to my own foot at the time.  They were very wide prints, and appeared neary flat-footed.  I was curious, though I hadn't made the Bigfoot connection yet.  It had seemed odd to me that someone would have been barefoot this far into the woods.  The tracks came out of the nearby woods, down to the creek bed, and they then followed the bed for a while away from the lake and into the deeper wooded region.  After a few hundred yards, they turned up a slight grade and into the woods on the opposite side from which they started.  Another thing that made me suspicious of the prints were that they had crossed the rocky creek bed, which was filled with sharp, shale-like stones.  It seemed to me that it would have been a very painful experience for any human to walk those rocks barefoot.  I noted that the larger prints were set wider apart than the smaller prints.  Still not making a BF connection, I went back to the houseboat and said nothing to my family. That night my brother and I were in our sleeping bags on top of the houseboat, still parked in the same spot.  We were both drifting off to sleep when we both heard a very loud scream.  It sounded like it was fairly far away.  At first, I thought it had been a woman screaming.  Then I hear the scream again.  It started off sounding like a baby beginning to wail, but then got louder and more high-pitched like a woman's voice in full scream.  It seemed resonant, like it was coming out of a hollow tube.  As it ended, it dropped down into a low gargle-like growl.  Both screams lasted maybe three seconds each.  It was then that I put the footprints and scream together in my head.  Though my brother heard the screams also, we didn't really talk about it.  My brother buried his head in his bag, while I tried to stay awake to listen for more sounds.  After a while I had fallen asleep, and awoke the next morning to find that my family had already moved the houseboat out of the cove as I slept, so I didn't get to go back to investigate the footprints again.  I did not tell my family about my Bigfoot suspicians, but my brother did mention to me later that he heard a \\\"bear\\\" walking along the shore that night, near where the houseboat was aground.  He said he heard heavy footsteps, heavy breathing, and some grunting.

But I was raised in Redding, CA. I have hunted all my life, and have heard various critters around and in my tent. My friend Chris and I were camping out one night during the summer on Mt. Shasta Bally. I figure it was between 1:00 and 2:00 in the morning. My friend and I were awakened by something walking around the pickup, where we were sleeping in the bed of the truck. My first thought was bear, 'cause there are a lot of them in that area. I have had many bears walk around my tent in the Thousand Lakes Wilderness Area near Burney, CA. But this did not sound anything like a bear. It was then that I noticed my friend was awake and looking at me. He asked me, \\\"What is that?\\\" I really didn't know what to make of it. It seemed to be about 40-60 feet away from the truck when we first looked at each other. It circled the truck and when it was near the thicker brush it seemed to come closer. Then it really freaked me out because we smelled a really wild smell. It kinda reminded me of the smell of my dog after he got tore up by coyotes. At the time, Bigfoot never crossed my mind. But my hair totally stood up on the back of my neck. My friend was in the same state. We were both armed with large-caliber handguns at the time but were too scared to sit up and look. We both just laid there looking at each other. I could hear myself breathing and tried to be as quiet as I could. Something inside me told me that if you sit up you aren't going to make it off this hill. This thing circled the truck for what I would guess to be about between 1-1/2 or two hours, moving closer, breaking branches -- what sounded like on purpose -- and making grunting sounds. Some time before it got light, it seemed to move off to the southwest. When the sun came and it was light enough to see we got up and looked around the truck. We never got more than about 30 feet from the truck before we noticed disturbed pine needles and broken limbs on the trees about 6 feet off the ground. My friend and I left that morning and went back into Redding. We told a few friends and my Dad about what happened. He had no answers either for what happened. I can remember thinking that it sounded like something walking on two legs. That really shook me up that day and to this day I will not go back on Mt. Bally at night. I have been back to that spot probably 50 times since then during the day, but towards evening times it bothers me to even be near that mountain.\", \"location_details\": \"You take 299 West out of Redding.

Down to the south is a small clearing. The moon was out and we noticed some movement in the clearing. The moon gave off just enough light that we saw a figure move slowly across the clearing. Lucky, my partner, thought it might be a bear, so we didn't pay it much mind. I guess about 10 or fifteen minutes passed, when all of a sudden we heard dry brush breaking up on the side of the mountain. From where the camp is located we were on the east side of the mountain. From that point the mountain goes straight up. Lots of brush and timber. Suddenly, whatever it was started screaming and we could hear it crashing through the brush. It scared the hell out of us. Then it must have turned and headed uphill. It was still screaming but it sounded like it was getting further away. We were both too shook-up to move, so we just sat there not saying a word. I guess about 20 minutes passed without hearing anything, then all of a sudden we heard a log come flying down the mountain crashing through the brush. Then it started again: this time the screaming was louder and seemed to be closer. The wind was coming from the north, which was where the spring was. All of a sudden it smelled like something had died. It smelled like a strong urine odor. The smell was overwhelming; it was like somebody had opened an outhouse door or something. And the screaming was louder than ever. Then all of a sudden it went quiet. We stayed up another hour or so before we decided to turn in for the night. We put some more wood on the fire and got in the tent and got ready to sleep. Then it started again. It lasted about ten minutes then went quiet, but then it really got scary. The light from the fire was pretty bright and showed through the tent. We were both hugging our deer rifles, wondering what would happen next. All of a sudden we both saw a shadow come between the fire and the tent. It moved slowly and was very large. Then as quickly as it started it ended. The next morning we searched the area for foot prints but were unable to find any. What we did realize was that our pickup was parked right near the spring and there was a very large log that had not been there the day before. We figured maybe whatever it was didn't like the pickup so near to the only water in the area. It was a very dry year and all the natural springs in the area were dry, so this was the only water for miles. I have hunted this area for the last 25 years and I have back-packed in the back country all my life.

The first time was one summer in the late 1970s. My friend and I were camping in the Tahoe National Forest in California. We were camping out of a station wagon, as we did not have a tent. My friend was cooking on the Hibachi, and I was sitting on the tailgate of the station wagon watching him. We were in a newly planted area of seedling pines. The surrounding that area was old growth pine trees. I looked over at the old growth area and there stood Big Foot. He was about 5' tall, and hairy all over. His eyes were large as if he were use to living in darker environment. I told my friend to turn around slowly, and look, as he did the Bigfoot melted out of sight back into the forest.  After we had gone to bed for the night around 2:00 AM in the morning, something hit the station wagon so hard that it rocked back and forth. Scared me half silly. The windows were clouded inside with moisture, and the night was dark.  The next time I saw Bigfoot, I was at Lake Shasta in the late 1990s. Wayne, Ginger the dog, and I were bass fishing on the lake, and the weather was warm. On the shore was Bigfoot walking down towards the water. When he got there he swooped his left arm down into the water as if he were checking a trap to see if there were any fish in it. He stood up and walked up the steep hill without any effort.  He was huge.  From the boat he appeared to be at least 7 to 8 feet tall. He had long shaggy hair, very dark brown. While all of this is going on Ginger the dog was going berserk. She was running around the boat yelping and howling. I told Wayne there is Bigfoot. He did not see him. The place where we had launched the boat was in the Jones Valley Resort area. When I tell people I have seen Bigfoot, and they think I am crazy. I'm not. Cousin Bob went out fishing with Wayne not too long after that. He said he saw something also.

Not even insects were making any noise.I had been sitting in front of a small, almost-out fire for some time when I heard a large tree branch break about 50 yards away. It was sort of an instant 'pop' sound and the branch never hit the ground. Initially it startled me but after about 10 minutes I had just written it off as one of the normal noises that the woods make at night. Then I heard another branch break in the same fashion maybe 10-15 yards from where the first had been broken, again never hitting the ground. Within a minute or two I heard approximately 10 to 13 VERY heavy footsteps heading more or less in my direction. Then after a few more minutes had passed I heard another branch break about 10 yards from were I was.

There were a lot of us. I was 13 at the time and I had never heard of Bigfoot. The way our camp was laid out was that all of us girls (two sisters, their friends and a friend of mine) were all staying in one big army tent. My brother and his friend were in a smaller tent off to the east closer to the drop off to the lake. Then my parents were in their own tent at the far west end of the campsite. There had been a lot of trouble with bears that summer so all campers were advised to hang their food high up in the trees. My Dad did that and I remember him standing under the bag of food a good three feet over his head about 10 to 15 feet from the door to our tent to the left. My Dad was 5'10\\\". As for myself, I really wanted to see a bear. I was a very outdoorsy kid and would have preferred to sleep outside of the tent actually. I had little fear of the dark, or the night, and it was my goal to see a bear. I am quit sure we were there for two weeks that year and as I remember it, my sighting occurred about a week in to being there ... since I spent several days after that looking for traces of what I had seen. I slept closest to the door and somewhere during the middle of the night I heard a little stirring outside. Everyone else was asleep and I didn't wake anyone since I had already been informed (emphatically) that no one else wanted to see a bear. I very quietly and carefully crawled to the door of the tent and cautiously stuck my head out the door. I looked over to where the food bag was hanging and saw something that was unquestionably NOT a bear. What I saw was two dark hairy creatures just standing there under the food bag like they were negotiating how to get it down or something. One of them was a good foot taller than the other. My Dad would have come to the bottom of chest of the biggest one. They were just huge! The smaller one was probably just a head taller than my dad. I had that as a gauge after all since I had seen my Dad standing there in the very same spot under the bag, and he hung the food bag in the same place every night. They were VERY tall and very upright. I had never heard of a Bigfoot at that time, but I knew these were not bears. Bears are pear shaped and standing upright isn't a position of comfort for them. For that matter, they don't just 'stand' next to each other like they are carrying on a conversation. The incident took place very quickly. It was fast, but I was VERY impressed and it was clear to me immediately that I was seeing something extraordinary. What happened was that as I saw them, and saw that they were something unexpected, I did one of those surprised intakes of breath ... a true 'gasp' I guess you could say. They heard that and both turned and looked at me. Then, they turned and looked at each other, looked back at me again, and then ... they were just gone. They made not a sound. One moment they were there, and then they were not. I did not go out of the tent. I did think about it, but ... I laid awake all that night thinking about it. I had absolutely no idea what I had seen. The next morning the first thing I did was go out in the direction I saw them leave to see if I could find tracks, but the earth was very hard and dry there. I didn't see anything. It might be that someone more skilled than I was at the time might have found some trace, but I didn't. I did spend a goodly amount of the remainder of that vacation watching and walking in the woods. I recall I even passed on water skiing a few times to go search the woods. I didn't tell anyone what I saw until a few years later. I told NO ONE at the time. I was the youngest in my family and already endured a considerable amount of teasing on a regular basis ... you know, kid stuff. I was not about to tell anyone I saw a 7 foot (or so) tall hairy man creature in the campsite. It would not have gone well. Oh, what I saw of them ... Hairy, with long hanging brown to black hair. I didn't catch any gender features. I just assumed the smaller one was female, but I have no reason to think that since I was mostly just seeing their height ... and the fact that they looked at me ... they LOOKED at me. Uh ... there just aren't words. I did catch that the arms were quite long and they were very big in the chest, shoulders and upper arms, not so much in the hips.  Nope these were not bears at all. I do not recall if there was any strong scent associated with my sighting. I didn't know what I saw until a year or so later when I saw a picture of the famous movie footage. I was so excited to see something that looked like what I had seen. I am 49 now ... I will never forget.\", \"location_details\": \"This was at the McCloud Campsite on Lake Shasta.

My son and I took a short vacation to my childhood memories trip area to French Gulch where I remembered an eerie thing that happened back in the mid 60's with my father. I had lived with my grandparents in an small town called Summit City just a few miles below Shasta Lake Dam when my father one day took me to French Gulch way way back deep into the woods North and North East of the French Gulch town. I remember always feeling as though being watched and sometimes herd really eerie sounds. I remember the eerie sound that made this worse for me to be comfortable. I was a naturalist though and always felt drawn to the deep woods and so it was hard to keep me from it. In latter years after retiring from the U.S. Army I took a trip visiting relatives in Redding, and one evening I packed up the truck for an deep adventure back to those woods and was their mostly to get those big pine cone's with delicious pine nuts. We left late that evening, getting their as it turned near dark and I felt my memories would help me find the places I had been as an teen with my dad and park and get some sleep and then wake up at some old cabin. It was as if I could practically reach out to the stars that clear bright night and (as well the moon was out partially) some of the ledges on those high peaks were a bit scary driving by them as it was so dark and far down I couldn\\u2019t see how far. Then after about three hours of this turn and that and many miles I had forgot to count, and my son fell asleep; I became tired and stopped. I turned off the truck engine and left the headlights on as I saw so many pine cones about an foot or longer and I began to load a few up. I had a camper shell on the little Plymouth arrow Pickup and could lock ourselves in for the night when time came. Before I stopped, I just happened to turn the truck around on the road as it made it easier to load some of the pine cones and as I got out beginning to loading more pine cones, that is when I heard that noise and it was very close. I was petrified at the sound as it is nothing like the elk calls that sound a bit eerie too. I began to slowly pick up a few more pine cones as these were only for decorating for our Christmas seasons and as in my childhood days, I would get the green ones that made it from last autumn and were still on the pine trees as I was still the tree climber. I had reached down to pick up the fifth pine cone and it was then I just froze up and full of panicky fear. I could hear up the side of the ledge, ridge, to my right clearly a heavy pounding of what sounded like something very large. Only two distant sounds pounding the ground and the damn thing was coming fast. I dropped the pine cones at once and ran up to the driver\\u2019s side fumbling in fear with the door trying to get in the truck. Then I started the truck up and was trying to put it into 1st gear and jammed it in just as I let out the clutch awaking my 7 year old son. I had heard the sound coming down behind the right rear of the truck just before I got the truck started. I happened to look back in the darkness behind the truck as it darted forward and in the dimness of the tail lights I seen this awful dark hairy figure standing upright behind the truck. The moon and the stars were out which helped me see this figure form as well. I had been stricken with such fear that I had never known before at this moment and nearly drove off the side of the road when my son said, \\u201cDad, watch out !!\\u201d. I then nearly flipped the truck over, just missing a small log. I had no gun with me.  I would have not feared what this was, and would have shot in the air as a warning or at it if I had to. It was that darn eerie sound and the sound of the thing coming down the steep hillside, and at that second the issue of absolute fear of not having any defense, that got my spirit stirred. I knew for sure it wasn\\u2019t a bear, as that memory is still just as plain to see today. It took a while before my son got me to say what happened on the way back as I was barrowing down the mountain as fast as I could, and am surprised I didn\\u2019t forget each turn I had to make on the roads I chose going out on the way back. We just pulled into French Gulch when daylight was breaking and I had to stop and sleep for an hour or so when my son woke me up whining about being hungry.  I woke up a bit dazed and it came back to me what had happened and I started up the truck and headed back for Redding.  My son was teasing me, \\u201cOh dad it was probably just a bear\\u201d. We reached Uncle Bills place on the right side of the road well before Redding where he lived on some property of his brothers wife\\u2019s Father; an Italian whom passed away. Still to this day my son teases me at his age 23. I was a ranch care taker a few years back in Flagstaff, Arizona, and I had seen a lot of things and heard a lot of things, but nothing that could ever compare to what I experienced on that early morning above French Gulch, and I surely didn\\u2019t want to.  I always carried a gun with me on that ranch just the south side of Rodgers Dry Lake even in the surrounding woods. Their were signs posted before entering that forest North of French Gulch stating to keep out during the evening (Night) and cut firewood only during daylight hours.  I hadn\\u2019t been their for so many years and wanted to experience what I remembered as an teen, but I sure wouldn\\u2019t have if I had known what I would have encountered that night. I\\u2019m very serious, because I've studied the Sasquatch or Bigfoot ever since, and would go with someone else today and be a lot more prepared for such an venture, but never again alone like that night and without some serious protection. I have never herd of where this big beast has come up on some one like me and acting like it did, but it sure did with me. I hope someone does get some physical evidence because I haven\\u2019t enjoyed being teased all these years; also we could put an end to the mystery of this beast. I've known what it was like to have big bears visit at night up in the high country of the Colorado Mountains, Rabbit Ear Mountain-Pass area, where I camped with wife and our first born.  I\\u2019ve been around the world and seen a lot of things from the mountains in West Germany and in South Korea in the Ming Dung Mountains where the Siberian tiger still remained back in 1975.

I was on Shasta Lake riding my Sea Doo one last time before I sold it. I had headed up the Pit river sometime in July. It was approximately sometime after 2 PM.  I had gone up quite a ways up toward the pot river and had decided to head back toward Jones Valley resort.  I always love to scan the ridges looking for shapes like you do when you hunt.  I came around a big  turn in the main channel and it was the most bizarre thing I had ever seen. About 20 feet from shore I see what I initially believed to be a big hairy head with eyes staring directly at me. I would say within a couple seconds it simply disappeared under the surface of the water. I was wearing sunglasses and I remember thinking  did I just see what I think I did?  I gave it a wide girth and slowed down and circled the area for about 2-3 minutes. I remember feeling freaked out a bit having this vision of it lunging out of the water at me.  Shortly after I continued back to Jones Valley resort and tried to put it out of my head. I wish now more than ever I would have taken the time to search for it but I just figured my initial thought had to be incorrect. I reasoned naturally it had to be something else. A beaver? Muskrat? I can't say for sure what it was but I know it was big. I do know my original feeling was it was a big hairy head and face with eyes. It had appeared to be wet already like it had already submerged previously. It was dark brown and tan in color. I know it was not a human.

Several councilors would sign up each session for excursions on  1 to 3 nights away in the back country. This hike was during the second session in early July. We had completed the major stretch of the four hour journey when we came over the ridge and could see East Boulder about 3/4 of a mile below. There were 4 councilors and about 25 boys and girls ranging in age from 9 through 15. We had stopped for a last gulp of water at a clearing just below the rim of the ridge when several of the campers began to squeal excitedly and pointing at the steep slope directly to the northeast and to the right of us. Not more than 50 feet away at the same elevation stood an erect hairy creature looking right back at us. One of the kids yelped, \\\"It's a bear!\\\" Tim, one of the councilors, muttered, \\\"That's no bear.\\\" The details are still vivin in my memory. The creature was leaning against its left arm which pushed it out from the canyon wall. The right arm swung back and forth as if for balance and it bobed its head irregularly. It was about 5'6\\\" tall, covered with long reddish brown fur with a large flat face and round yellow eyes. During a discussion later, Sunny, who was studying biology at UC Davis, insisted that she observed the creature to have a hairless chest with large round protruding nipples. This led her to conclude that it was possibly female. The creature held its ground for a little over 1 minute before it spun around and ran away from out group upward towards the rim to the right of us. As it ran it sent a landslide of skree down into the valley below. When it reached the ridge it turned and peered back at us once again and then disappeared over the edge. Much excitement followed and the decision to continue down to the lake and set up camp was made. Curiously, there didn't seem to be a trace of fear among the children although all the councilors, myself included, did admit later to being afraid. The first thing after dark that I noticed was a powerful odor that came from the Ponderosa grove. The closest comparison I can come up with is that the smell is skunk like but muskier with a hint of urine. The entire camp began to get a whiff of this odor and the animated discussion about the sighting during the afternoon became hushed. In the quiet we could hear landslides from a number of different places midway up the ridge, a dim green light about the size of a small grapefruit. The odor intensified and the snapping of branches not more than 10 yards away sent the whole bunch of us into a cluster around the fire. The odor was intense when a large shadow figure took several long deliberate strides through a gap in the trees. It had to be about 7 feet tall. I saw this creature only once but others in the group saw several dark forms over the next 2 hours. Shortly after midnight an 11 year old boy in the group began to complain of great pain in his lower abdomen. This pain increased over the next hour to the point that he was laying on the ground pulling his legs up towards his chest. The councilors agreed that it appeared that the camper was having an appendicitis attack. We drew sticks and Larry and Tim headed out in the dark back to the main camp to bring a stretcher with a four wheel drive truck to the logging road just over the south ridge. Sunny and I remained with the group, some of them sleeping and others tending the campfire. At the point when Tim and Larry's flashlights were no longer visible, the odor departed as well and the night became still and quiet. The next morning shortly after dawm, Tim Larry and Warren, the camp director, arrived at the camp with a olive green military stretcher. Warren would later question every member of the group. He observed that the key elements of the story were consistent in each telling. He conceded that we had indeed experienced something strange but insisted that the concilors present agree to the possibility that what we had seen were bears.\", \"location_details\": \"East Boulder Lake serves as a reservior for the city of Callahan.

I was helping out a graduate student at Humboldt State University with his Master's Project (we studied wildlife and plants associated with freshwater ponds in the forest near Willow Creek). One  weekend, my girlfiend and I drove up to the Salmon River to go camping. Its a remote area; it seemed that most people up that way were either miners along the river or fire crews. Near Forks of Salmon (town) we stopped and camped at a pullout near the mouth of the Little North Fork. The next day, we hiked up the stream, went swimming, (even saw a black bear on the trail) and later drove home. The following morning (Monday) my coworkers came to pick me up for the week's work, but I realized while packing that I was missing the telephoto lens to my camera. I remembered using it on the Little North Fork photographing a frog. Figuring I had laid it by the stream and forgotten it, I did not join my two coworkers.  Instead I called my girlfriend, told her what had happened and asked if she would like to return to the Little North Fork. Instead of roaring up there and back (about 100 miles ?) we decided to make a backback trip out of it.  We got up there, hiked the trail, found the lens, but decided to drive further up the paved road to a spot somewhere near Sawyers Bar where a dirt road followed the North Fork and led up to a trailhead where hikers could further follow up the North Fork and into the Marble Mountain Wilderness Area. It was dusk, so we donned packs and got up the trail as far as we could before it got completely dark.  There were no obvious camp sites so we rolled out our bags and literally slept in the middle of the trail. Its old growth forest and we felt pretty alone. The next morning we got hiking again, following the North Fork up a long forested valley.  We passed one other couple that day who had stopped to swim and set up camp. We hiked on another four miles and the trail left the river; it snaked up along the side of the canyon and became more of a narrow path. Always the dirt beneath our feet was covered with the prints of bears.  There were no human shoe prints, just bear prints. It was getting late again and the topo map indicated a stream would cross the trail some distance ahead so we pressed on figuring to set up camp there. We soon heard water. At the crossing we were very tired and were ready to drop our packs, but we both had a very uneasy feeling about the spot and agreed we could'nt spend the night there. Consulting the map again, we found that the trail branched a little ways ahead and an unmaintained primitive path headed up the mountain to a small subalpine lake that we had earlier planned as our destination. The map showed the creek to cross the primitive trail shortly after the path left the main trail. We figured the trail junction might be a good place to camp since it would be close to the creek but hopefully without the feeling we experienced here. Soon we got there and found a small open area between the trees just off the trail, level and large enough for our sleeping bags and a fire.  We dropped our stuff and then went down the start of the primitive trail to the creek (20-30 yards). It was in a steep, boulder-choked, densely forested draw full of log jams left from spring or winter torrents. It was barely a creek now in mid-summer. It was getting dark and again we had a bad feeling about being dwon in the creek bed.  We hurriedly filled our cooking pots with water and got back up to our packs. We were tired.  After cooking, I remember arranging our pots and pans along a log on one side of us and the fire on the other side. I hoped if a bear entered camp during the night he might knock the pots off the log and thereby wake us up. Sometime in the middle of the night (I had no watch, but the fire was completely burned down to ashes and coals) I awoke to a terrible racket going on down in the streambed through the trees below us. It was the sound of logs and large rocks being hurled and crashing into things. I sat up in the dark and listened. I shook my girlfriend and told her to wake up. She at first buried her head in her bag and did'nt want to hear the sounds.  I was really scared. It was totally dark, I knew there was no one around for miles and I also knew that bears do not go rampaging around throwing things. I also knew darn well that anything living out there could probably smell the remains of our fire. Whatever it was was clearly spending a lot of energy either trying to scare us or angrily searching for something in one of the logjams. After listening for maybe 10-20 minutes (its really hard to know how long) my worst fears were realized. The crashing sounds stopped and soon there was the sound of footsteps coming up the slope directly toward us. It was on two feet and they were clearly audible, heavy footsteps. By this time my girlfriend was wide awake and sitting up in her bag like me listening. Although neither of us said it, we both were thinking of what it had to be. With the fotsteps came the sound of labored breath. Whatever it had been up to in the stream bed clearly had been hard work. I had a sheath knife, but standing to fight seemed out of the question: it was dark, this thing was big, and I was petrified. Just as it came up behind the trees immediately surrounding us, I flicked on my little flashlight, hoping to keep it at bay with the light. The light did not penetrate the darkness beyond the nearest trunks. The creature stopped just behind the nearest tree trunk (15 feet? away) and just stood there breathing. The sound of the breathing was at least seven feet up in the air. I yelled \\\"Hey!\\\" with as load a voice as my adrenalin could muster. The breathing paused momentarily and the creature made a \\\"humph!\\\" like sound in response, not to me directly, but more to itself. It was very careful to not reveal itself and used the tree to avoid my light striking him. After this, it turned and walked through the brush and trees directly away from us, not back toward the creek but parallel with the creek, heading downstream.  The stride was unhurried. We quickly built the fire back up and stayed awake until dawn. After the sun came up we got some sleep. After breaking camp we dropped down to the creek before heading up the path on the other side.  I looked around briefly to see if I could see what the creature had been doing, footprints, etc., but I found nothing. I wish now I had gone down or upstream a bit, since the sounds may not have originated at the crossing like I assummed at the time.  We got up to Lake of the Isle (kind of a shallow cirque lake as I recall) in the afternoon.  There were some old campsites there but no recent evidence of people. The place was scoured of firewood, though. I spent a lot of time hauling wood up the hill so we would have enough to last all night.  I also stockpiled throwing size rocks. That night we could'nt sleep.  We would hear rustling in the brush near camp.  I would throw rocks in the direction of the sounds (probably racoons or black bears) and  build up the fire some more.  We did that all night until dawn. We fnally got some sleep.  When we awoke we both decided to bag it and hike out.  We packed our packs and hiked all day. The last mile or so to the car we hiked in late dusk; the thought of spending another night out there was out of the question. We were so paranoid by this time, we jogged the last half mile. That's it for the incident.  Although we did not actually see the creature, neither of us have any doubt as to what it was. Up until that point in my life, Bigfoot stories were like the Loch Ness Monster: something intrigueing that you sort of wanted to believe in but could never be sure about. For me, the matter of Bigfoot's existence was resolved that night 25 years ago.  \", \"location_details\": \"Hike up the trail from Little North Fork Campground.\", \"county\": \"Siskiyou County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 5637: Campers have frightening experience in the Marble Mountains Wilderness\", \"latitude\": 41.31917, \"longitude\": -123.1778, \"date\": \"1977-07-01\", \"number\": 5637.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9r27j1btt5\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.1778 41.31917)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Dear BFRO, I had an interesting and very frightening experience back in 1984. I was backpacking with two friends in the Marble Mountains Wilderness in Siskyou County, Northern California. We were camped by a lake in the southern portion of the wilderness about 20 miles from the Klamath River east of Somes Bar and north of Fork of Salmon. It was just after dusk and we were settling down for the evening, having spent the day hiking and fishing. We heard the sound of a tree limb break about 50 yards from camp. At first we thought we heard a black bear attempting to steal our food, which was in a nearby tree hanging in a bear bag. When we approached the tree, a friend noticed two amber-colored eyes staring at us from the woods up the hill. The eyes were reflecting the light of his flashlight. We watched it and it watched us for about a minute. Assuming it was a bear or deer, I tossed a rock in its direction, hoping to scare it away. The eyes then rose vertically several feet, as if the animal stood up from a crouched position or reared up on its hind legs. Realizing this was a large animal, presumably a bear, we paused a moment and then I threw another rock at it. This time the creature began walking down the hill toward us on its hind legs, taking alarmingly large strides. I am an environmental engineer with a pretty good background in wildlife biology and had encountered bears many times in the past. I had never seen a bear walk on its hind legs like that - down a hill strewn with fallen trees and large rocks. This thing was very agile and moved quickly toward us. Alarmed, we ran back to our campfire to alert another friend. After a minute or two, my buddy again caught the eyes in his flashlight just outside our camp about 30 feet away - just outside the area illuminated by our campfire. The animal then proceeded to observe us for about 3 hours, circling our camp, but always remaining far enough away from the fire that we couldn't clearly see it or photograph it. It took large strides on its hind legs and stood approximately 7 to 8 feet tall, judging by its height relative to trees it stood by. The thing kept circling around watching our every move and would not leave, despite our shouting and noise making. It was extremely unnerving because we were about 12 miles from our car in the middle of a very remote wilderness, in the pitch black darkness of night, with no weapons to defend ourselves. Had this thing attacked, we were more or less defenseless with no help for miles around. Interestingly, it kept its distance and was not really threatening us. It seemed more curious than anything else. I felt more or less like an animal being observed in a zoo exhibit. Usually, a bear will enter your camp and sniff out your food/kitchen. This creature kept its distance and remained walking on its hind legs the whole time, which bears do not do. The animal's demeanor seemed more curious than menacing. The thing never made a sound, which would have helped us identify it or confirm our fears that it was not a bear and was indeed a bigfoot. In desperation, I threw some camping fuel on our fire, which released a huge ball of flame and a blinding flash of light. This must have scared the thing away, because when the fire subsided, it was gone. The next morning we checked for footprints, droppings, and any other sign that could indicate what it was. I suppose the hard, dry ground wasn't suitable because we didn't find any discernable tracks, which was really dissapointing. Thus, I can't prove with photographs or casts of footprints that we really saw a bigfoot, but, aside from a large and very agile bear, I can't explain what it was. This was a really intense experience and is the honest truth! My buddies and I have vowed to return to that lake with battery powered spotlights and better camera equipment again sometime and see if we enconter this creature again. Hopefully, if we are lucky enough to see it (or its offspring) again, we will get photos to prove it. I would very much like to see the scientific community officially identify and recognize this animal as a true North American species. I am no longer a skeptic.

I don't know why we weren't afraid or curious enough to get up and follow its movement. If it were a bear or coyote, I'm sure we would have. But it was more like seeing a deer or elk in terms of our reaction. The next morning, I went over to where we had seen it and tried to follow the path it seemed to take from the manzanita down to the lake. I was unable to find any evidence, no footprints in the mud by the lake, no disturbed pine needles with moisture or dirt showing and no broken branches or hair in the manzanita. The area though at the edge of a forest reaching to the coast was also a frequently-visited tourist spot and not the sort of place I would ever expect to see such a thing.\", \"location_details\": \"California, Shasta County, Castle Lake\", \"county\": \"Siskiyou County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 2842.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"I was travelling down a couty road from a friends camp, and I was riding a small Honda motorbike.

About five minutes after I went outside, I noticed a faint, but still very pungent, odor on the breeze. Kind of a cross between skunk, rotting carcass, & very dirty wet dog.  I've lived in the area all of my life, and hunted around the local hills and gulches, and have not encountered a smell quite like this before or since.  The smell came in on the breeze from the west of the trailer, up the hill from the property. I am a believer in the Sasquatch, having read, watched, and listened to as much information as I could get my hands on from the time I could read. About a week after the incident, I was working on a bicycle on the back porch, at about, 10:00 or 10:30 P.M., when I heard a low gutteral growl/hoot type noise, coming from behind me.  I would say from the volume of the noise, the critter that produced it was, maybe no more than 100 to 200 feet away.  That would have put the area it was in about halfway between our trailer, and the neighbor up the road.  Due to spending a considerable amount of time in the woods hunting, and just hiking around, I have encountered or heard just about all of the wildlife in this area, this sounded like nothing I have heard before.  The strange part of the encounter, was the fact that our German Shepherd Rottweiler cross heard nothing, nor did any of the other neighbor's dogs.  I went inside to retrieve my handgun and a flashlight to check around the vicinity, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

The incident from 1997 was more of a Class B incident on the Klamath River directly off of Hwy 96. The incident in 1998 was during a solo backpacking trip in the Marble Mountain Wilderness where I hiked over 95 miles by myself. In 1997, I was working in the field conducting a survey to the National Forest users about federal land issues. It was an internship, and my field partner and I spent almost every night outside. The night of the incident was late summer, the second week of August. We had conducted the survey at a fishing and camping campground on the Klamath River and decided to go find our own camp for the night. We chose an undeveloped site just downhill from Hwy 96 that had nice sand bars along the Klamath River adjacent to a parking and picnic area. The parking area was situated between the river and the Hwy and was downhill from the hwy. The road and the river run parallel to each other here. Ben, my field partner, parked the car, and we grabbed our sleeping bags and a few items and went to crash for the night on the sand bars. Late that night, probably around midnight, we woke up to a large creature walking, actually limping, like a step, drag of foot, step, drag of foot, along the hillside below the road and above the river and us. It sounded like Eigor, but was definitely a two legged creature. We thought it was a person. It was limping along this slope that was covered in about 12 inches of oak leaf duff and the drag of the second (possibly injured) foot was loud through these leaves. Ben asked me if I could hear it, or was I awake. I said yes. I jumped out of my sleeping bag and grabbed a light and a knife. I shined the light up to the hill but could see nothing, and the movement on the hill stopped when I shined the light. I sat in my bag firmly gripping the knife with the light off. It continued to walk along the hillside coming closer to us. Suddenly, it reached a point on the hill directly above us and let out a gnarling, gutteral yelp. Not a scream, but a cry for help. Over and over again, this gnarled inward drone was very loud and continuous. Honestly, Ben and I could see nothing, and just sat there frozen. Waiting. We must have sat there waiting for over an hour, and the creature did the same. It was about 30 feet up the hill from us. Again, in honesty, Ben and I were not scared, and somehow, we both fell asleep. I think I relaxed finally, and just waited, and somehow fell asleep. I awoke some 20 minutes later to a huge splash in the river directly below the sand bars we were sleeping on. Across the river, the next day we could see nothing. No tracks in the sand, no tracks in the leaves, no nothing. We both agreed that it was not a bear, not a cougar, not even a human. There was only one explanation and it was sasquatch. In 1998, actually, I'm going to submit this one on the next one, because I think I'm close to 20 minutes.

The Klamath and the Marbles are particularly rugged and steep terrain. I hiked from Etna Summit at the PCT trailhead and looped all the way through the Wooley Creek drainage, attempting to get to the Cal-Salmon River. My attempt failed and I hiked to Little Elk Lake and on out to the group of lakes outside of Lovers Camp trailhead for the full distance. On day one I hiked over 14 miles on the PCT south from Etna SUmmit. On day two I left the PCT and hiked to a large marble outcropped ledge above the Wooley Creek drainage below a large, unnamed peak. (I can consult my map for a definite location, but do not have one available at this exact time). The night of my second day out, I slept on this nice marble ledge, beside a small creek about 2 feet wide that was more of an ice drainage from the steep, glacial peak above. This creek ran down the ledge and off a cliff that is about a 200 feet drop to a boulder field below and about 800 feet (or more) down to the Wooley Creek drainage. The 200 foot cliff below the ledge is VERY steep and to a tradational climber would be rated at least a 5.9 or 5.10 chaucy climb. So, there I was, in my purple Marmot bag, all cozy and tucked in. The night was clear and was about 4 days before the full moon in late August, so it was bright. I was sleeping parallel to the little brook running along the Marble Ledge and about 15 feet from its banks. I fell asleep and woke up to a wierd noise that was very far away. I was already frightened of animals because I was by myself. It does not matter, but I am also female. I was scared out there by myself. But having the time of a life. The noise so far away seemed to be way down in the forest in the Wooley Creek drainage. It was loud, however, almost like a yelling or a whooping. It was consistent and occured one yell after the other. I didn't worry too much, and was not concerned because it was so far away. The yelling truly happened one after the other. And, it was getting louder and perhaps closer. I still was not concerned as it was far enough and I was atop a huge cliff, so I felt safe and unreachable. However, the yelling got louder and closer yet, and started to travel up the boulder field below. At this point, I had heard the yelling for 20 minutes. Again, it was a consistent howl, or whoop, over and over again. I just laid still in my bag and realized that not only was this yelling thing was coming up the boulder field but coming up the cliff. Sure enough the creature was climbing up the cliff. AND FAST! The whole event was this thing running and hooting/inward drone yelling up the drainage, up and up to the cliff and beyond to the top of the peak. Sure enough when it got to the cliff it pulled and climbed itself up \\\"swiftly and agile\\\" as I put in my journal. It literally dyno'd every move on this 5.9 cliff and yanked itself up the cliff to the top where the ledge was, where I was. The creature, in the mean time, was still consistently calling/yelping/hooting. It got to the ledge and started running toward the peak above. As it got closer, I pretty much urinated in my sleeping bag. But I just laid still; I was extremely frightened. As it started to approach the ledge close to where I was, on the other side of the brook, I could see it. It was a silhouette of a huge running gorilla. It ran on two legs but dragged and pulled with its arms. It was huge. The arms were almost the length of half its body and was covered in hair. It was black, but I really only saw a silhouette. The head reminded me of the abominable snowman from the Christmas, Rudolph movie. It just ran and howled, but then stopped slightly when it was parallel to me. It stopped howling, and slowed down slightly, and kind of hesitated. It turned its head toward me as if smelling something, but then immediately turned forward and really started running even faster. And louder and faster and then climbed up to the top of the peak and called and called for nearly four hours straight. Until almost sunrise. I stayed awake the whole time. I got up the next day and entered a short entry in my journal and packed up and continued on my journey.\", \"location_details\": \"I can confirm the exact location at a later time when I access my map.\", \"county\": \"Siskiyou County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 22434: Backpacker sighting off the PCT in the Marble Mountains Wilderness\", \"latitude\": 41.28996, \"longitude\": -123.056, \"date\": \"1998-08-03\", \"number\": 22434.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9r26zu977q\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.056 41.28996)\"}, {\"observed\": \"It was a loud piercing sound, that lasted approximately 22 minutes.

I was a logger for 15 years, in and around northern California, and I was a timber faller, probably 5 years out of that period. Timber falling puts you out in the really remote areas, and we were always the first guys in there to drop the timber. I started working a real thick area, and began working my way back threw the thick woods, my plan was to reach the very back portion of the sale, and then cut my way back toward the logging road. The first day in there, I had the feeling of being watched, thinking it was just our boss spying on us, so I gave no further thought to it.  The next morning I spotted large tracks in the muddy areas.  It had rained hard that night, so the tracks were not sharp, and they were not from a bear.  Further into the woods, I came up on a flat spot in the faint trail that smelt so terrible, that I almost gagged.  It smelled like wet dog, a very filthy wet dog. Just past this spot is where I spotted what appeared to be human droppings. What was weird about the dropping is they were really huge, not trying to act like an expert on droppings, but the largest piece was about 18inches long, and 3inches in diameter. This really freaked me out, because there was no body else in the area. My partner was working over the other slope, and actually went out another way. The cruisers were out of this area about two months back.  This stuff was fresh looking, about a day or two old, tops. My partner was a Kroch Indian, and I didn\\u2019t know the guy that well, we just paired up for that season. At quitting time, I sort of approached him about the idea of bigfoot, and he said, \\u201cthey have been in these woods for ever, and my people have told me many stories about them.\\u201d  \\u201cYou white guys just make fun of what ever the Indian talks about, so we keep it to ourselves.\\u201d And, that was about it. I guess if I took him to a bar on Friday night, and got his tongue oiled up a bit, I\\u2019d have learned a bit more, but I dropped the subject.  We finished the sale and that was it. This area was really secluded with lots of deer sign.  I had a habit of mapping and remembering really good spots for future deer hunting, and prospecting spots that I would use during the winter lay-off. This particular spot, after logging, was strictly off limits, as it was part of the Fruit Grower Company's land, and after logging they would lock up the roads. It didn\\u2019t matter how long you logged their property after a sale it was shut down, and you had to stay out!   Well, hunting season arrived, and I breached the locked gate, and snuck in there for a day of hunting.   I took along my ever-present companion, Pappy, my hunting cow dog.  Him and I were inseparable, because he didn\\u2019t know fear, and would attack a grizzly if you didn\\u2019t keep him under control.  He had a good nose, and located many a deer that got away from me. Well, we got into the same area that I had spotted the droppings, and Pappy went on purple alert.  His fur went straight up and he acted totally weird.  He came to a halt and refused to go any further down the trail. I never saw him act quite this way!  Just 100 yards up the hill I spotted movement.  It was crouching down behind a buck-brush bush, and it just crouched there staring at us.  It was completely unnerving!  I realized I was illegally in that area, and this might be another hunter, or a DFG cop ready to bust my butt.  Note, guys were always getting busted for hunting on the California line or the Oregon line. It was just a bad spot, and it was so close to each border, it would be up to that game warded. Well, I had a Remington rifle, in a 270 caliber, with a 3x9 scope, and not really wanting to aim a rifle at another hunter, I sort of swept the total area, like I was looking for deer.  What I saw chilled me to the bone!  It was not human, and that\\u2019s about all that I can really say!  To this day, it looked like a king sized Eddy Munster, and it didn\\u2019t look ape like, but it sure as hell wasn\\u2019t human.  The eyes, were what got my leg\\u2019s going, because I wasted no time getting back to my truck and getting out of there.\", \"location_details\": \"Hilt, Ca. is located right off the 1-5 freeway in the most northern part of Ca. on the Oregon border.

I became very nervous when my dog stood still, looked away from the house, and growled. We lived on nine acres in a rural mountain setting near a river and at first I thought it might be a cougar or a bear in the dark. Then I shined the flashlight in the direction the dog was staring, and I saw two large hairy animals go over the fence. The larger one was about seven and a half feet tall and was a female.  She just stepped over the five foot tall barbed wire and wood post fence like an athelete.  The smaller animal was about five and a half feet tall and it used a fence post to help it leap over the fence. They both had yellow eyes. Like a cat. Their hair color ranged from a very dark to a  light brown. They both had an ape like head. Then I ran back inside with my dog and told my mom and dad that I saw two Bigfoots. At first I was really scared. Then my parents went after it,not to hurt it but to see it up close. I wanted to go but they woudn't let me.(BUMMER!)

In 1979, my father and I went camping in a remote spot on the summit of Mount Shasta, well away from anyone else.  At approximately 3 AM, on a moonless night, I was awakened by a noise within our camp. At the time, I thought that it was my father up to relieve himself.  Which I thought was odd, since he rarely woke up, because he usually slept like a log. I was sleeping in the bed of our truck, since my tent was mildewed. I could hear something moving around the truck thru the windows of the camper shell. Something kicked over the ice chest, and I laughed out loud, thinking my father had tripped over it. Yet, I heard no cussing, as he was prone to do.  Something hit the truck with such force, that the truck rocked violently. I thought I it was a joke being played on me by my father. Then, I heard something that sounded like a rabbit \\\"screaming\\\", yet, much louder, almost raspy, yet very piercing.  Needless to say, I was afraid for my life. I grabbed my rifle and waited. Then I heard nothing but the sound of my father unzipping his sleeping bag, and then his tent. He asked if I was \\u201cOK\\u201d, and what happened.  He had awakened to the sound.  This may sound like a prank, fuelled by my father, but he would not dent his truck for a prank, that was his baby, and the pay for repairs was certainly not worth the laughs. The camp was a mess, and we noticed that the eggs were gone. Nothing else.  There were no visible tracks.  We were far from the road, so bare earth was not around.  We had no fire only a camp stove.  I don't know what the significance of the missing eggs was all about, but we did find the carton a ways from the camp that morning.  I doubt any of this will help in your research, but the egg thing still puzzles me.

I was visiting Joe and his Mom, because I have known them since I was about five or six years old.  My friend and I took a horse back ride in Humboldt county, up the Salmon River, with a guide that has cabins there.  He takes care of these cabins, and they are about a three-hour horse back ride, up the river.  I met James, the guide, through Joe\\u2019s Mom, because he was staying with her when I got to California. I can\\u2019t remember James\\u2019s last name. We stopped after about an hour and a half of riding, to water the horses, which was the Salmon River.  One of the horses got spooked, and was very jumpy, we thought maybe there was a mountain lion around or something like that.  All three of us saw this large ape looking thing walking along, like he was following us, so James jumps off his horse and threw a rock at the thing, but it wasn\\u2019t startled.  It just kind of backed off into the woods. We started to ride again, and we were following the river upstream to his cabins, and the river was way below us when we saw a large black ape looking creature down by the river again.  My friend Joe and I were kind of freaked out by the thing, but James said it had happened before and not to worry about it.   We got to the cabins later on in the afternoon, about one thirty or so.  We grabbed our rods to go to the river, because James said, \\u201cthere is pretty good fly-fishing down there\\u201d.  Joe and I were down at the river, when we saw this thing again.  We took off and told James that it was on the other side of the river, up the embankment, and in the trees.  So, he grabbed his rifle and went to where we were fishing, but it was gone. So, that night we were sitting on his porch telling stories about what we thought this thing was, when James said \\u201cthat what we had seen was a bigfoot, and he had encountered him several times before\\u201d. James continued, saying \\u201cthat it goes up into the mountains several times during the summer\\u201d.  Then we heard something by the tree line, and his horses were jumpy again. So, we just sat there and waited to see or hear anything again. All we saw was a black outline in the trees, which startled us again. The next day, James's water supply, from the river, was clogged up somewhere up the river.  He has this thing where the water from the river drains into, and he can get running water to his cabin. So, we all took a walk to see if we could find the problem, and when we found it, the thing that the water drained into was busted up.  It was stepped on by something, and we blamed bigfoot, and that\\u2019s pretty much it for the story. James said \\u201cThat it wasn\\u2019t uncommon to see a bigfoot this time of the year, a lot of people have seen it\\u201d.  Well, that is pretty much a common thing around there, I guess?

The moon was full, and we were able to do the hike without flashlights. When we got to camp we set up our tents, and then we proceeded to the campfire.  Since this camp is at the tree line, which is about 10,000 feet, you are not able to build your own fire. You are either at the main fire, or in your sleeping bag, because it is cold. As I sat at the fire, I, and only I, looked down to the meadow that has the trail you hike up on. I knew that my two friends were coming up the trail behind us, so when I saw a large man at the base of the trail (less than 100 yards away) I thought it was my large Native American friend with long hair. I did think that it was strange that he was standing in the meadow alone, without a backpack, at two o'clock in the morning. We looked at each other for a while and then he started to walk off into the forest. I thought that was bizarre also, since it was really cold and again, if you were not by the main fire, you were in your tent. After wondering what he was doing, I turned my attention back to the fire, expecting my two friends to show up at any minute. Well, they did not show up for another hour. I asked my friend why he was down in the field earlier without a backpack, and our friend, swore to me that they just arrived. I then knew what I saw, and I have been a believer ever since.

I was around 8 or 10. We were camped on a river, with no one around for miles, and deer would frequently cross the river at our campsite. We kept our trash bagged up approx 30 yards from our camping area to deter bears from being drawn close to the camp area. We had 2 adult dogs and 5 newborn puppies as well. The female dog had pups on the trip. It was late at night approx 10 pm and my sister and I were in our tents sleeping and my parents were at the fire talking. My father put a few paper bags on the fire which caused it to rise quite dramatically and that\\u2019s when it started. From approx 50 yards near the trash area, came the loudest shrillest most powerful scream that my first thought was a fire engine (I was young). The adult dogs, including the protective mother started whimpering. They were medium sized dogs, not huge but not small either. The scream started traveling down river at a rapid pace. It died off to a deep growl. Whatever it was, it was very large, you could feel the immensity. You could hear this thing for what seemed to me was an eternity but honestly was probably a good few minutes. I went to the bottom of my sleeping bag and all I can remember is that I was terrified. My sister was awake at this point and the next thing I remember was my father unzipping the tent asking us if we had heard that, we replied and the next question was if we wanted to go or stay. Now, my father was a forest fire fighter for 12 years and an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He was one of the first people to have been helicoptered into a fire in California, and he had heard just about everything in the woods. This man was scared.  Unfortunately he did not bring his rifle with us on that trip he always had his trusty 30-30, why not this time I don\\u2019t know. I remember seeing the fear in his eyes, and I was already scared, so it was unanimous. We packed up that night and drove 8 hours to our home in Ventura California. We had never thought about a Sasquatch up until that point. It wasn\\u2019t until we were watching an episode of \\\"In Search Of\\\" with Leonard Nemoy back in the day that they had what they said was an actual Sasquatch vocalization. I remember all of us watching it in our living room and hearing that noise on the TV and all of us looked at each other, it was the same noise. To this day I wish to god we would have stayed until morning to see footprints or something. My parents were very no nonsense nonbelievers in just about all questionable things. Now we all believe in Sasquatch. Why did the dogs whimper? What was the huge animal that made that sound traveling so fast? What made my father so afraid that he packed us up and we left at midnight for an 8 hour plus drive home?

It was late and it was a boring uneventful dark drive up this \\\"Bigfoot Highway 96\\u201d, but finally we crossed a bridge on the Klamath River and got to a campground where we finally saw trailers and trucks and people type stuff. The road then goes up a switchback to a ridge for a mile or so, and I slowed my speed down to 25 mph. So, as I got to the ridge, maybe a couple miles from the bridge, I came around this last switchback, and to the right my headlights swept the left embankment and I thought there was a bear coming down the embankment towards the highway. I slowly crept ahead and began to stop as this bear was shuffling down this embankment on two feet, but it was not a bear. I stopped completely and not over one hundred feet in front of me was this thing intent on getting across the road the road in front of me. If I didn't see it on the bank I probably would've hit it, because it was that close. It got to the center line in three long steps and looked at me and then jumped off the road.  I mean from the centerline on its right leg it jumped clear off the pavement and over a two foot embankment and was out of sight. It was not overly tall probably just six feet or a little taller, but extremely was thick maybe in the 300 pound range this thing was built. It was hair not fur and matted and dark brown but with a rusty auburn tint to it. I was extremely close with high beams on, and stopped in the road. It had long arms like a gorilla or something, and it sort of lumbered forward like a gorilla only fast with definite long strides; it had something it was aiming for and when it looked at me it turned its head back straight and this thing jumped off the road like an elk on one leg. It had extremely thick legs and shoulders, and no man could make a jump like that. If I had a video camera in the dash of my car you would have seen the video of your life. I couldn't make out any genitalia it was so hairy I would estimate its body hair like six inches long and matted and dangly, but not so much on its butt or the back of its legs. I could make out the thighs and they were some guns. I was too scared to get out of my car to look over the embankment, that and my daughter was freaked out. Get the heck out of here. I took a picture of the hillside he came down. I can find the exact spot and in fact am on vacation this next week and I got an infrared camera and a motor drive dslr this time, and oh, I ain't getting out of my car without my gun.

I don't want to hurt anything, but I don't want to get my head ripped off by something just on the other side of the dark roadside either.  This sighting was at 12:55 am and I was wide awake. I checked my odometer from where I saw him it was forty two miles to the next bridge on the river at a small town before I got to the freeway on 96. I am a recreational hunter in my younger years but this isn't something you hunt; this is something you gawk at. Oh and as close as I was the eyes didn't glow. I must have counted 60 deer along that road and I saw eyeballs everywhere in the road along side the road from that ridge to Yreka. This thing didn't have glowing eyes, and I had the high beams on and watched it cross the road and look at me. It didn't have animal eyes that glowed.

During that first fall I would hear a strange whistling call that would come from a Sequoia tree that stands out in about 2 acres of blackberries that surrounds my yard. The berries run down to a thermal spring on the property that itself runs down to \\u201cI\\u201d creek, which is around 50 ft. further up the hill from that creek. I thought this was a stray bird of maybe a tropical sort perhaps lost by someone. It would call to me in a guttural clicking sound followed by a series of sing song chirping whistles. I would call back, and then it to me and so on and so forth for around 20 minutes to 45 minutes before it would stop. It was always at dusk towards night and so I would call it a \\\"night bird\\\". There have also been numerous times that I smell a strong wet garbage smell that shows up suddenly in my yard and house. The latest incident is taking place around every few days now, at least for the last three and one half months. This smell shows up in the late spring and usually stays around off and on through the last apples falling from the fruit trees on my property. I rent. I have sensed something looking at me from the steep hill across the road from my house that comprises my back yard. Sort of like the feeling one gets when a puma is near. The other night I had an incident where the creature I am talking about banged on my trailer at around four in the morning. When I went outside on the porch to see if it was somebody, I had every single hair on my body go up instantly. I just knew that whatever it was; was right there. I beat feet into the house and locked the door. The early morning smell was so strong that I couldn't even sleep. It smelled like a garbage dump. I have been around lions and have had the hairs on the back of my neck go up, but never anything remotely like this. I have heard very heavy thumps coming down the hill behind my house late at night many times during these same seasons. They sound like very heavy footfall. There is one particularly loud thump that I can hear that I think I have identified as this thing as it jumps from the road next to my house down into the my yard on its way to the creek. I have seen it twice now. The first time was around four in the morning when I walked out of my trailer onto my front porch. The door squeals so it makes a lot of noise and when I opened it I must have startled the thing. At first I thought I had just seen the biggest bear of my life until it registered in my head that it was running on two long legs, crouched over. I noticed that it was swinging two very long arms. It was the fastest moving animal I have ever seen. [In 2005] I reported it to a place here called J.B\\u2019s deli and was put in touch with [Carmine (Tom) Biscardi -- a.k.a. \\\"the Great American Bigfoot Research Team\\\"]. They came and investigated and now I have a live video feed coming from two spots near the creek. The second time I saw it was at around one- thirty in the morning a few weeks later. I noticed the apple tree in the far corner of my yard going berserk. The big branches were really shaking hard. I had a night vision scope so I took it outside and looked through it but the tree settled down and I did not see anything so I sat the scope down. When I looked back over there I saw a human form from mid upper arm up walking towards the creek at the edge of the berry bushes. The bushes are around six plus feet tall, and this thing was perhaps two feet taller. I saw large rounded head on very large rounded, thick shoulders. It seemed to have very little neck. I could see that it was hairy and got quite a good view because it was silhouetted by a light on my neighbor\\u2019s porch. My daughter was staying in a tent out in the yard a few nights later and was awakened by some whistling and then by something hitting her tent. Like something had been thrown. There has been a print found on my property also. It is around 19 inches long and about 8 inches wide. I have never seen anything like it, but it looks like a giant human footprint to me. These incidences are ongoing. I think this thing summers here. What do you think? Also, do you have any suggestions on your experience as to how I may be able to study it or observe it here? I would be delighted at any input. Excerpts from Report # 12910                                           October 27, 2005 OBSERVED: I have new possible evidence on the hill behind my house that I and a few friends of mine have found, and we desperately want someone more qualified to look at what we have here. I would appreciate talking to someone ASAP so that I can connect with you for a possible story. For two years I have heard a whistle and chuffing sounds coming from the berries bushes in my yard. I thought it was some lost big tropical bird. I would call back to it, and it would call back, and so forth. I have had some bad odor incidences including one that woke me up from a dead sleep and gagged me. A volunteer found a footprint up the hill behind my house and some friends of mine, [T. C.] and [N. M.] found additional footprints and hand prints in an area up the hill from my house that appears to be some form of crude camp. I have been there three times now and the second time I went there I observed that some 4-5 inches around 4-5 ft. long branches have been brought from some where other than that location and laid in a sort of rectangle fashion around a depression in the earth. There are more of these depressions without branch borders in the area. There are snapped trees at @ the 10 ft. level; there are \\\"huts\\\", for a lack of a better term made from big branches. Some look older and some look recently made. There are also snapped trees and tracks that seem to form a path from this site down the hill towards my house. [N. M.] Found two pretty fresh handprints that appear to be coming out from one of the \\\"huts\\\". The finger tips are spread much farther a part than a human could have done. We found three separate footprints there that did not seem to be very old, maybe a couple of weeks, but no more. I saw the Bigfoot three times now, once at 4 AM in the morning, and twice at 1 AM in the morning. It was very dark each time except once it walked in front of a light and I got a good look at its height and silhouette.

As it stood up from the blackberries in my yard it was eating, I saw two long arms and two very long legs. It began to run north towards the path I have that goes thru the berries to the creek, and I said to myself' \\\"that's not a bear\\\". I knew I had just seen a Bigfoot. WOW!!! I saw it run towards the creek and I heard it crashing through the bushes down there. I did not follow. I'm not usually a scared kind of person, but I did not follow because I was scared. I had never seen anything like that in my life. I live in the woods and I have seen lots of bears and large animals. I  consider myself good at estimating, so I estimated it as 10 to 12 ft. tall and it probably weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 1200 lbs. no lie. Later that day I went down and looked on the trail the way it had gone. I found horse hair ferns that had been torn out from an area of about a thirty foot radius where something had torn them out and made a large \\\"bed\\\", for lack of a better word, there on the ground near a natural spring that comes out from under a maple tree. I walked down to the creek and found the tops of two very large footprints in the sand at the very edge of the creek. The prints disintegrated into the water as I watched them, but I was pretty freaked out by then.  On with the story... Every night for a whole summer I would smell it in my yard, it smelled like a mixture of wet dog, garbage and sewer...if you can imagine that. One night the smell woke me up gagging. I thought it was a bag of garbage I had left out on the porch that night. You see, it is so much easier to stay in a sort of denial when you see these things. It really is too hard to believe what you are encountering. Anyway, the cameras were up in my yard at that point and I had these computers in my house so I sat down at the computer and started looking at my emails. There is a window right next to my sliding glass door where my porch and stairs are. I heard a small sound behind me at that window while my back was turned away at the monitor and when I looked I saw a huge dark face in that window. The face was tilted slightly and I could make out the shiny spots at the brow and bridge of the nose. It was very dark outside and what I saw was the reflection of the things face in the light from the dining room. I looked at it and it looked back at me for a few seconds and then it turned away. A few seconds later I heard a loud bang as it slammed something into the end of the trailer. I looked later and found a big dent. I got up and ran out onto the porch. I actually thought it was pranksters. I got out on the porch and noticed how dark it was in the yard at that point. I yelled, \\\"Get out of here!\\\" I thought that would scare away any kids that might be in my yard when suddenly every hair in my body stood on end. Have you ever been around a lion when the hairs on the back of you neck stand up, \\u201cYeah kind of like that\\u201d, but about 50 times stronger?  I suddenly thought...man, this thing is right here in the yard with me. I promptly panicked...ran inside...and locked my door. A few nights later I saw it walk across my property. There is a field light across my property in my neighbor\\u2019s yard and I saw it backlit as it walked down to the creek. I saw a tall figure...@12 ft. tall with large mounded shoulders and a sort of conical shaped head. I saw very long arms swinging as it walked. I could only see the top portion of this guy because it was walking by 8 ft. tall blackberry bushes. I went up on the hill behind my house with a friend and we found a footprint up there. It freaked me out too because I wasn\\u2019t expecting to find anything to tell you the truth. We made a cast and I would very much like to have that cast. I heard it is in litigation. I have been up the hill above my house since then and I have found places with big holes in the ground where \\\"beds\\\" have been made. Some of them have crude frames in them made from 12 inch diameter snapped off branches that are crisscrossed to form frames. I thought that was strange. In those places there are numerous foot and handprints.\", \"location_details\": \"I want this story to get out because I want scientists and serious researchers to have the chance to verify it, and help me study it.

Observed: This trip was, in actuality, an expedition my brothers and myself had planned into the mountains of Siskiyou county. Our rationale came from an obscure Californian document called which records one of the earliest Sasquatch encounters in the state as having occurred in this area.  In addition, the book also goes on to note that it was well known amongst the locals at that time that these creatures wintered in the caves, \\\"makes winter quarters in some of the caves of the Marble Mountains\\\".  We also felt that since we would, in all likelihood, be the first people into the backcountry this early in the season it would increase our chances of encountering some sort of activity. An early scouting trip on 5/10 supported our suspicions. Late afternoon on Monday, May 10th, we left our hotel in Yreka and headed out into the mountains to familiarize ourselves with the trailhead we would be using early the next morning for our hike into the valley. The weather was quite raw, chilly with cold rain. At approximately 4 pm, as we were winding up the forest service road, we came to what may be described as an overlook or turnout. We decided to pull over and get our first real look at the mountains we would be hiking into the next day. We stopped the Jeep and my two brothers bounded out of the front and began taking pictures. I was just opening the rear door on the passenger\\u2019s side when I suddenly heard what I can only describe as a loud and prolonged, \\u201cAHHHHH!,\\u201d coming from my 11 o\\u2019clock from a low hill roughly 400 yards away. It was a very strange sound and completely unlike anything I had ever heard in the woods before. (I live deep in the High Peaks of the Adirondacks, so I am no stranger to backcountry sounds.) It sounded like a man sort of yelling but it had a deep, animal-like quality to it. I asked my brothers if they had heard the sound, but they said that they hadn\\u2019t. In fact, I believe that they thought I was joking. After a few more minutes of snapping pictures, glassing the slope and waiting around to see if whatever had made that sound was going to make it again (it didn\\u2019t) we piled back into the Jeep and continued up the mountain. We followed this road all the way to the trailhead (one of our two options for tomorrow\\u2019s hike) without incident. Coming back down the mountain, we now turned left onto another forest service road to reconnoiter the second trailhead. Conditions immediately went from raw to terrible. This forest service road is unpaved and the cold rain now changed to snow the higher we climbed. (Our elevation at this point was somewhere between 3,500-4,000 feet.) There had obviously been snow at some earlier point because the road had roughly an inch to an inch and a half of old snow scattered on it and piled up on the sides in patches. My brother suggested that we might want to get out of the Jeep and scan the side of the road in order to see if we could come upon any kind of tracks. We were not thinking \\u201cBigfoot\\u201d at this point, we were just trying to get an idea of what kind of animals we might be encountering in the next few days. Almost immediately, we found some large and clear bear tracks. These were good-sized tracks and I would guesstimate that they were from some 300-500 lb. animal. (Again, I live in the Adirondacks and we are well stocked with bears.) I mention these tracks because as we were following them up the hill we came across a very different set of tracks. At approximately 4:45 pm we encountered a second set of tracks crossing the road. These tracks were moving perpendicular to the bear tracks we had been following and were clearly NOT bear tracks. The first track was approximately 17-18 inches long and 6 inches in width. It looked exactly like a naked human footprint, but there was little visible arch. In other words, it was rather filled in where you would expect the arch indentation to be. The print appeared to be from a right foot and a clearly defined big toe was visible. It also seemed as if the bear we had been following had stepped directly into this track but it in no way obscured what we were looking at. These two types of tracks were directly before us so that I can say, as far as comparisons between the two, this new set of tracks had come from some completely different animal. Following the track, a 2nd track was discernable roughly 4 to 4 \\u00bd feet from the first track across the road. This track was much more degraded than the first track but appeared to be from a left foot of consistent dimensions with the first. The conditions wouldn\\u2019t allow for any casting and, besides, we had left nearly all of our equipment back at the hotel. This was supposed to have been an in-and-out scouting run and, consequently, we were poorly prepared to document any findings. The spotty snow and the lay of the land discouraged our finding any more tracks and so, snapping too few pictures, we continued up the mountain to the junction near the lake. I must add, at this point, that our finding of these tracks in no way involved any skill on our parts. This was an instance of pure \\u201cDUMB LUCK.\\u201d If we had arrived any later, the quickly deteriorating weather conditions would have destroyed these tracks without our ever having found them. We were extremely lucky to have come across them when we did. It must also be noted that there were no signs of anyone else having come into that area before us. The only tire tracks in the mud and the snow on that road had come from our Jeep. Until we had gotten there, everything seemed to have been completely undisturbed. Further up, the road splits with the right fork heading toward a camp and the way ahead leading toward a lake. To our left was an animal corral and a short road leading to a dead end in a gravel excavation. These details would be important later but, for the moment, we decided to try forging up the road toward the lake. The way soon became impassable with snow and, having gotten the Jeep stuck a number of times, we turned back to begin our return to Yreka. Returning down the FS road we were approaching the overlook/turnout where I had heard the strange, \\u201cAHHHHH!\\u201d We were discussing this sound when we decided to enter the turnout again, being much more focused and alert this time, to see if it would repeat itself. At 5:35 pm, we put the windows down, turned the Jeep off and coasted into the turnout. Almost immediately the same prolonged, \\u201cAHHHHH,\\u201d came from the same direction from which I had heard it the first time. My brother in the front seat said, \\u201cI heard that!,\\u201d and we all got out of the Jeep. It was deathly quiet after we had gotten out, but two of us had definitely heard the sound this time as we had entered the turnout. After waiting a few minutes for a repetition of the noise and getting nothing but silence in return, my first brother asked my second brother to \\u201cWhoop\\u201d at the hill which the sound had seemed to come from. I was returning to the Jeep when my second brother let out a bone jarring, \\u201cWhoop!\\u201d (a skill he apparently learned on two previous, official BFRO expeditions.) I did not hear it, probably due to my position in the Jeep, but my first brother said that within several seconds of my second brother\\u2019s having \\u201cWhooped,\\u201d 5-6 hard wood knocks suddenly came from the same hillside where he and I had heard the strange vocalization. We are all very clear on what happened next. We were all out of the Jeep now, straining to hear if we could catch any more wood knocks when a blood-curdling scream suddenly came from our 2 o\\u2019clock. It was a very high-pitched, prolonged, almost feminine sounding scream that seemed to be coming from a fairly good distance away. (I don\\u2019t want to speculate on exactly how far.) The scream did not in any way sound like any type of big cat or some kind of bird. It sounded like a loud, human scream. It was startling and more than a little unnerving. My second brother gave another loud, \\u201cWhoop,\\u201d but we got no further responses. After the scream, the woods remained quiet. With absolutely nothing happening, being a little rattled and with evening closing in, we got back into the Jeep and drove to Yreka for the night. May 11th, weather conditions were beautiful as we drove into the camp trailhead early in the morning to begin our hike into the valley. Temperatures were expected to be near the 70\\u2019s and the sky was bright and clear. We thought that we would be able to hike the roughly 7 and a half miles into the valley in about 5 hours. 60 lb packs and much more snow than we had anticipated quickly put an end to that idea. We decided to retreat to our fallback position and attempt an entry from near the lake. We knew from the night before that road directly to the trailhead soon became impassable for the Jeep a short distance beyond the camp junction, but it appeared from our map that it would be a relatively short hike in to the trailhead from where we would have to ditch our vehicle. While we had encountered snow up from the junction, we hoped that it was just a bad patch and that the snow would break and the hiking would be easier once we got through that particular area. Again, that proved not to be the case. Stuck now and wondering just how we were going to get into the valley, we realized that we were going to have to make a choice. We could either scrap our idea of getting into the valley from these approaches, take the long drive into Eureka and attempt an entry by going up a creek, or make camp somewhere in the immediate area and attempt a dash into the lake area with extremely stripped down daypacks. Hating the idea of another long car ride and of wasting another day without getting into the woods, we opted to find a spot close to the camp / lake junction. Driving the Jeep up the dead end road, past the animal corral, we set up camp in the old gravel pit. Our camp was situated in a flat, roughly 50 yard in diameter hollow, ringed by rough mounds of rock and gravel. Our GPS indicated that our base camp was sitting at 4,862 feet. Aside from having to hike a short distance downhill for water, our camp offered us a relatively protected haven on the mountaintop. I want to make our situation clear in light of subsequent events. We did not intend to be where we were. We were forced to make last minute decisions if we were going to try and stay with our original plans of getting into this specific valley. Our position wasn\\u2019t ideal, but it did provide us with a moderate degree of comfort and a footing for making a dash into the desired area. We settled into our camp and the rest of the day passed uneventfully. After a dinner of some MREs, we passed a very quiet and bitterly cold night. The morning of May 12th couldn\\u2019t come too soon. The night before had been almost too much for the gear (20 degree bags and a couple of three season tents) we had with us. I woke up at about 6:30 to winter cold and an icy tent. My second brother was already up while my first brother appeared to have retreated to the Jeep sometime during the night. He had gotten his feet wet before climbing into his bag and had been forced to use the heater in the Jeep to stop his feet from freezing. We decided to leave him in the Jeep and let him sleep. At around 8am, my second brother and I decided to gather some snow to make coffee. As the gravel pit was entirely snow free, we had to walk down past what we had nicknamed the \\u201cOK Corral\\u201d to the junction, where there was still plenty of snow. Off to our left, a couple of hundred feet down a very steep decline from our camp, we could hear the fairly loud rushing water of a creek. As neither of us relished the idea of trying to work down that decline and then struggle back up just to get some water, we were going to make do with the snow at hand. We were just beginning to gather some snow when we suddenly heard the sound of rocks being banged together in the creek bed below us. It was very clear and very distinct. The rocks were being banged together in series of threes. Bang-Bang-Bang. There were always three bangs with equal intervals between strikes. To me, these bangs sounded entirely deliberate. After the first three bangs, I said to my brother, \\u201cDid you hear that?\\u201d He was replying that he had when the rocks banged again. Thankfully, I had brought a Handy Cam with us and I now started shooting. My brother decided to try another of his \\u201cWhoops\\u201d to see if we could get any response from whatever was banging rocks together in the creek. He let out his \\u201cWhoop\\u201d and after 5 seconds we suddenly heard four loud bangs from down in the creek bed. Again, these were very loud bangs and they were clearly being made by whatever was down in the creek smashing stones together. This last series of four bangs were clearly picked up by the Handy Cam. After the last series of bangs, there were no more sounds from down in the creek. Excited and a little flustered, we rushed back to the camp to wake up our brother in the Jeep. After getting him up, we told him what had happened when we had gone to gather snow. He was excited, but said that he had been sleeping and that he hadn\\u2019t heard a thing. A Zoom H2 that we\\u2019d had running at the time may have picked up the banging in the creek but hasn\\u2019t been properly reviewed as of this writing. At roughly 9am, my second brother and I were sitting around drinking coffee and getting things ready for our attempted dash into the lake area. My first brother was walking toward the steep slope on the edge of our camp that lead down into the creek when suddenly a very loud, canine bark startled all of us. The bark sounded like a large dog\\u2019s, \\u201cWoof.\\u201d The sound had come from close below us, somewhere back in the direction of the OK Corral. We all looked up and I fully expected to see a big dog come running into camp being followed by a ranger. No such dog or ranger appeared. In fact, we looked everywhere to find the animal that had made that sound but nothing was moving on that mountain. I have heard deer and elk \\u201cbark\\u201d and this deep \\u201cwoof\\u201d was nothing like that. It sounded exactly like the biggest dog in any suburban neighborhood. While that sound wouldn\\u2019t seem out of place back in civilization, it seemed entirely out of place and strange in our isolated setting. It was so out of place that we all noted it. Unfortunately, I had already packed up the Zoom for our hike and completely missed catching the sound. Cleaning up and shouldering our packs, we struck out for the lake. We started walking up the forest service road, making for the trailhead. From the trailhead, it would be what we had read was a comparatively easy, little over a mile hike in to the lake. From this lake, we would be within striking distance of a second lake, which figured into two sightings reports from last year (2009). It seemed pretty straightforward. It wasn\\u2019t. As the road rose up from the junction, the snow got worse. We would go through large patches that would come almost to our knees only to break through to long stretches of bare earth. It was slow going, but doable. If we had known that we would encountering so much snow, we would have been better prepared with snowshoes, poles and full winter gear. As it was, we were going through terrain in conditions we probably had no business to be attempting with woefully inadequate gear. No one said we were smart. About three miles in, we encountered a cinnamon bear. Off to our right, coming up quite a steep slope through a section of burn-out, a small to medium (about 200 lb) bear was lumbering towards us. The bear was about 30 yards away and, at first, didn\\u2019t see us. We stopped and, not relishing the thought of a closer encounter, we caught the bear\\u2019s attention and began to \\u201cidentify\\u201d ourselves. The bear stopped and a tense five-minute stare down began. The bear seemed to be standing it\\u2019s ground and didn\\u2019t particularly appear to want to back down. We yelled and tried to make ourselves look bigger, but none of this seemed to impress the bear. I make these points because before me, at relatively close range, I was able to observe a native bear in the wild and to see how this bear would move through these woods. This becomes important later. After yelling and waving for what felt like a long time, a can of Counter Assault was produced and we got ready for the bear. Suddenly my first brother, having had enough of this war of wills, shouted an expletive and began throwing rocks at the bear. This did the trick and the bear took off at a run back down the slope. I say this again to emphasize that I had before me a living example of how a bear looked running through those woods. We continued trekking into the trailhead, coming across deeper and deeper patches of snow, until we finally reached the true start of our hike at about 2 o\\u2019clock. Post holing now into snow at times up to our thighs and waists, it became pretty clear that the inner valley was effectively sealed off. Even though the temperature was in the low 70\\u2019s and it was a bright, sunny day, the conditions were just too much. We decided to make some lunch and then begin the hike back to base camp. We made a small fire and had some MREs. It was after 2:45pm when we started our return to base camp and the going wasn\\u2019t any easier on the way back. Later, my first brother confessed that he had begun to feel uneasy at the snowed-in trailhead. He had said nothing to me at the time, but he later told me that he had confessed to our second brother that he felt like we were being watched from the moment we\\u2019d gotten there.  Much later, after we\\u2019d returned home, he said that, at points, while we had been working our way back down the FS Road from the lake, he had had the strangest sensations. He said that he could feel a prickly feeling along his scalp and that he could literally feel the hair standing up on the back of his neck. He said that he\\u2019d never felt anything quite like this before and that it happened twice on our return trip. Subsequently, he began lingering behind my second brother and I and videoing longer stretches of the return hike. Neither my second brother nor I experienced this uncomfortable feeling of being under observation. Things continued like this until a point approximately 2 miles from the camp /  lake junction on the FS Road. At approximately 4pm, I was actually bringing up the rear. We were a little tired by this point and we had grown quite loud, laughing and talking. I was raising my hand in a sweeping gesture to finally point at the ridiculously steep grade of the ridge on our right which we were in the process of traversing. As I raised my hand, pointing and making some stupid joke, something suddenly moved on the slope in front of me. From about 30 yards up the slope, something suddenly darted out from behind a tree and ran up the slope to a second group of trees. My first impression was the size of the object. It was big, at least 6 to 6.5 feet tall. My second brother is 6\\u20192\\u201d and it was just about his size, if not a little bit bigger. It was bulky and muscular, and I immediately thought of a jacked-up football player. I could only see it from the waist up, due to foliage on the slope, but what I could clearly see was an upright muscular form running for the trees. I will elaborate more on this figure in a moment. My second impression was the speed at which the figure was moving. Whatever it was, it was moving over impossible terrain at a FRIGHTENING speed. I immediately thought that nothing that big should be able to move that fast. It was moving from left to right from one tree up a very steep angle of ascent (I guesstimate a 60 degree incline) at an angle to a second V-shaped group of two trees. It covered 10-15 yards in no time, moving over ground that we would have had to have climbed almost on our hands and knees. Once it reached that second group of trees, it was gone. I do not know what it did or where it went after it reached those trees. I also noticed that, whatever this was, it did not bob as it ran. It looked almost as if the figure were gliding up the slope on a track. I can say with utmost certainty, IT DID NOT MOVE LIKE A BEAR. This upright figure was nothing like the bear we had seen earlier. Whatever this was, it was unique and I have never, before or since, seen anything like it. My last impression was of its color. The figure appeared to be covered with a uniform coat of hair that was 2-3 inches in length. This hair was primarily of a coyote or burnt sienna color but there was also a lot of grey mixed in. Its fur looked almost brindled, meaning that there was almost as much grey as brown. If it hadn\\u2019t of moved, I never would have seen it. Standing still, the animal blended perfectly into its background. All of this transpired in the seconds it took this animal to travel the 10-15 yards between the trees. Looking back on the figure I had seen, I can say that its form was basically that of an upright human, but there were definitely some \\u201cgorilla-like\\u201d characteristics as well. I saw the animal primarily from the side with a great deal of back and shoulders being presented, as if it were turning away from me. It ran with its right arm folded across its face and seemed to be looking over the top of its arm as it moved. I could see no features because of this arm covering its face, but a conical head and the edge of what appeared to be a crest were visible. The animal displayed a pronounced musculature, and I was particularly struck by the sheer size of the bicep, its back and the massive traps. Like a gorilla, I could see no neck. As already stated, the foliage obscured the rest of the animal. I immediately shouted something like, \\u201cOver there!,\\u201d but by that time it was too late and whatever it was was gone.  I cannot stress enough to any one who has never seen an animal like this how profoundly disturbing the speed at which this animal is capable of moving is. I had been holding a Handy Cam on standby and ready to go and I was never able to get off a shot. I believe this is exactly why more of these animals haven\\u2019t been filmed: they just move too fast.  All I could do was stand there pointing with my mouth hanging open. My brothers asked me what was going on and I tried to tell them. I know that they did not believe me at first. I kept insisting that I\\u2019d just seen a \\u201cBigfoot\\u201d run up the side of the mountain and, gradually, they started to realize that I wasn\\u2019t joking. We stood there for a few minutes, gawking and staring up the side of the mountain into the trees, but there were absolutely no sounds or movement coming from the direction in which the creature had gone. My second brother went so far as to try using some \\u201csamurai  chatter\\u201d in hopes of eliciting some response from the animal if it were hiding close by, but there was no response. After about 10 minutes of nothing, we decided to continue on our way back to camp. I know that this was a decision that will frustrate many people who might read this report and it deserves a word of explanation. On my part, the thought of climbing up that slope to search for prints, hair, or possibly even another look at the animal did not even enter my mind. I must stress that the thought was never there to be dismissed. It was inconceivable. Now, I equate it to sitting in a small boat fishing when, suddenly, something large and unknown cruises under your boat. You do not think of jumping into the water to see what that large thing was. This is not fear. From my brief experience, all I can say is that you do not naturally want to move closer to one of these animals. The reason is as simple as that. Ironically, although my brothers hadn\\u2019t seen the animal, they didn\\u2019t discuss going up that slope either. It just didn\\u2019t feel \\u201cright.\\u201d From that point on, although we were all keyed-up and anxiously waiting for something else to happen, we returned to base camp without further incident. It was now sometime after 5pm and we had some decisions to make. Basically, we debated whether or not we should stay or, in light of that day\\u2019s activity, pull out. We opted to break camp and spend the night in Willow Creek. This decision also deserves a word of explanation. Our first consideration was the extremely difficult weather conditions that we had been enduring from the start of the expedition. We had been in snow and facing below freezing conditions that we had not been prepared for. The thought of another icy night in the tents or, worse, all of us crammed into the Jeep trying to stay warm were hard trials to think about. While the daytime temperatures were mild and pleasant, the nighttime almost 5,000 feet up in a gravel pit on the top of a mountain was brutal. In this regard, we were not being smart. Our second consideration was the thought of the animal we had just encountered, both directly and indirectly, paying us a visit in the darkness. While my brothers were game for such an encounter, I most definitely was not. This was not coming from fear on my part; I will argue that it was just good common sense. It was definitely going to take me some time to adjust to what I had just seen. In the end, my brothers gave in to my desire to pullout. I am grateful to them. I still don\\u2019t regret our decision. Feeling pretty damn happy with everything we\\u2019d accomplished already, we ended this leg of our expedition. Having had some time now to mentally digest what had happened during our short stay in these mountains, my brothers and I have put together some ideas concerning the activity we observed: 1. We definitely feel that whatever was making those \\u201cAHHHHH!\\u201d calls on our first day was acting as some sort of sentry or lookout. Whatever was watching the road only called out when we came into view and its position allowed it an excellent opportunity to monitor all possible human traffic into and out of those valley access points. (We did not hear it during our final departure from the mountains but it was getting quite late by then.) 2. Based on the fact that something screamed from a second position in seeming response to the first caller\\u2019s woodknocks, there was definitely more than one of the creatures in the area. 3. Based on my brother\\u2019s intuitions, my sighting, and a subsequent development, we feel that we \\u201cpicked up\\u201d something at the snowed-in trailhead and that this something was trailing us from higher up on the side of the mountain during our return hike to base camp. 4. I believe that my sweeping/pointing gesture caused the animal to believe that it had been observed and that this caused it to break and run for new cover. This is the only reason we even knew the animal was there. I also would like to add a final observation concerning the creature I observed. One of the names the Native Americans of Northern California have for this creature is Tintah-k\\u2019iwungxoya\\u2019n, which translates into something like \\u201cBoss of the Mountain.\\u201d I can think of no better name for the animal I saw. This animal seems perfectly suited for its environment. It can blend into and move through its terrain at will. Its size suggests a lot of power and its speed is startling. It outclasses us in the backcountry in every possible way. This animal could have, if it had wanted to, taken us at any time and there would have been very little we could have done about it. It definitely deserves our respect and protection. I would also like to add two postscripts to this report: 1. On May 13th,  we stopped by the China-Flat Museum to see the Bigfoot wing. While we were there, we were talking to Peggy McWilliams from the museum about what we\\u2019d experienced during our short stay in those mountains. After some interesting comments on her own part about those caves near the rim, she called our attention to a gentlemen who was just entering the museum. This gentleman turned out to be Al Hodgson. After some brief small talk, we told Mr. Hodgson about our recent experiences. He was quite interested and, at several points during our story, actually made the comment, \\u201cThat sounds about right.\\u201d We showed him the pictures of the tracks and these also seemed to intrigue him. When all was said and done, he very kindly asked us for our names and our contact numbers. As he was leaving, he turned to me with a smile and said, \\u201cIn forty years, I\\u2019ve never seen one.\\u201d He was a  gentleman from beginning to end, fascinating to talk to and a genuine pleasure to have met. 2. On May 25th, my second brother was reviewing the footage from his video camera. We had been shooting with two cameras and we had well over 12 hours of footage to go over. While reviewing footage we had shot on May 12th, he came to a portion that he had filmed after our return to base camp from our hike back from the lake trailhead. This footage was shot just as we reentered camp and were facing back toward the mountain and the junction. While it will never convince the skeptical, the video shows something large moving through the trees until it comes to a small clump. The object ducks down and then what appears to be a head pokes out on one side, facing in the direction of our camp. The shot ends after about 40 seconds. None of us had any idea at the time that the figure was there. It\\u2019s an intriguing end to a very intriguing experience. I am extremely happy to have some evidence to support my sighting. In retrospect, I am even more glad now that we didn\\u2019t attempt climbing up that slope after the running figure. This video seems to suggest that whatever it was, it never moved after it hid behind those trees. If we had climbed that slope, I now believe that the animal I had seen would have been waiting there. In all likelihood it would have run again, but I really would hate to think about having an up-close, face-to-face encounter with whatever was on that mountain. In addition, in light of the fact that this video was shot almost 2 miles further down the FS Road from where I had initially seen the creature, I now believe that this animal waited for us to move and then continued tracking us all the way back to our camp. While I don\\u2019t in any way feel that we were in serious danger from this creature, I feel even better now about having spent that last night in Willow Creek.\", \"location_details\": \"Please edit out location specifics.\", \"county\": \"Siskiyou County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 27819.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"On December 3 , 2011 we were heading east on hwy 96.

We were walking along an old camp road that had become overgrown with brush and scrub. It was obvious that bear had been using this trail as there was a considerable amount of bear sign along the old road.  We got to a point in the trail where there was an overhang of pine limbs over a slight depression on the right side of the old road.  Upon inspecting the depression we noticed what appeared to be a left foot print, and a right leg outstretched in the pine needle cover on the ground.  We continued to survey the area, and noticed what appeared to be more tracks leading away from this overhang and depression.  I took photos with a disposable camera.  I have the prints, but they did not come out very clear.  Which was a disappointment, but something to look at nonetheless. We finished poking around, and continued on our way.  We got just a bit further down the trail, and we walked through an extremely strong smell of skunk, or wet dog-like odor.  No sooner had you smelled it that is disappeared, but if you took a few steps back it was extremely strong again. I have been hunting and recreating outdoors for many years, and I am very familiar with skunk spray, and how it seems to permeate a large area.  This was not simply the spray of a skunk.  It was very centralized.  It was literally like you walked through it, and it disappeared, then you could turn around and walk through it again. The two of us spent a few moments looking around, and we noticed, something very peculiar.  In the middle of the trail and not far from this smell, and the foot prints we had seen, was a large pile of oak acorns.  The strange thing was there was not an oak anywhere near this pile of acorns!  They seemed to have been placed in this location.  They were not a collection of shells from squirrels, they were fresh dropped acorns.  Enough to hold a hungry deer, or two for a little while. We theorized that whatever had been hunkered down under the pine overhang in the depression may have placed these acorns, then set up under the overhang off of the trail in ambush. Our intent was to walk to the back of Pine Mountain, then still hunt our way up to the top of the mountain.  We had used this road for years to access the back of the mountain, and we were very used to the topography, so anything out of the norm would be noticeable to us. Chris and I team hunt very well together and after a short strategy chat, decided to use a 50 step method: one of us would go 50 steps, stop and whistle to let the other hunter know it was their turn to take 50 steps, and then just watch and listen.  We were approximately 130 yards apart. The ground was covered in heavy and dry leaf litter so the going was somewhat noisy.  I had gone nearly three quarters of the way to the saddle at the top, and I heard what sounded like a whistle, but not the whistle I recognized as Chris'.  I also heard what sounded like a very large boulder break loose and roll down the back of the hill.  I had assumed that Chris had rolled it down hoping to kick something out, but based on the last whistle, this rock was rolled from that area, and seemed to be 60 yards to my right, when Chris would have been twice that distance away from me.  I though that maybe he had gotten closer to me as we made our way up, but that would not have been the case in the past.  We work very well together and spacing is everyhting on our team hunts. We got to the top of Pine Mountain, and we had a discusion and he told me that he thought I had rolled the boulder, and vice versa.  I told him about the whistle, and he told me the exact same thing.  He also had this overwhelming feeling of being followed up the hill.  Like something was timing it's footfalls so as to not be detected.  I have to admit, I felt this way too, even more so after the discussion about the boulder.\", \"location_details\": \"Dry Creek Road comes off of Highway 29 out of Middletown, Dry Creek Road goes into the back country through much privately owned land, to our ranch.

It has been over 25 years, back in the late seventy's, and my family and I can still remember, to this day, what we saw and heard during our motorcycle outings in the mountains.   At one time, we use to have a cabin off of Sly Park Road in the Pollock Pines area, and we would ride our dirt bikes at least 50 miles a day never coming across the same logging trail twice. Well, the first time, we were on the trail walking, instead of using the bikes, towards plum creek. My cousins and my sister kept hearing things around us, and I remember my parents saying it was nothing just enjoy the walk. We all would hear branches breaking, and things that a child, at that time, would think to be very scary. Well, this time, we came across a large tree which had fallen within the last few months. This is where myself and my family, still to this day, give Robin my oldest sister hell. Our parents were behind us and my Sister, being a smart ass goes up to look at this jelly like substance.  She puts her finger in it, and tasted it. Well, it was not jelly, but blood, and this is what makes this about bigfoot. Just on the other side of this log, my parents who had just ran up to see what we were all talking about, found this large, and I do mean a large foot print. We realized we were looking at something that was made by a large animal/human. My Uncle who is a big man, he put his boot next to it, and the size of it made his foot look like a kids footprint. If I remember right, they were saying it had to be over size 16.  This was a fresh footprint and the blood was still wet, and all I can remember, was that we all started back towards the cabin like there was no tomorrow.  Now we can't say that the blood was from bigfoot, but I know there was a large footprint. There was more than one time we came across something strange like that. Another time, I remember we were all on the bikes, and this time, we were either coming from or going towards the old ranger station that was located on the top of the mountain.  Where you were are able to climb the stairs to the top, which was over 3 or 4 stories high. Anyway, I want to say this was towards Grizzly Flats. I kept all of the old maps so that I could share the places we went with my kids one day. Well, there was a little snow left on the grounds that day, and we were taking a rest. My Mom has a thing for being the first one to step in fresh snow, so she goes off doing her thing, and all of a sudden she starts calling my Dad, not yelling, but you can hear it in her voice to get the hell over to her now.  When every body arrived at her location, there was this huge print, and it was human looking. The only thing about it was, that it only had one big toe. It was like it had all the others toes cut off, or just never grew them in the first place.  This print wasn't as big as the first one that I had seen. I think we saw them about a year or two apart, so it was not the same day or anything like that. There were other times when we would be riding, and you could hear something like voices, but not voices if that makes since.  My Uncle eventually sold the cabin and we stopped going up there.  Now that I live here in the Sacramento area , I have driven back to Jenkins Lake area several times and find myself sitting and wondering about everything that my family and I had seen up there in the mountains.  We never really told anyone about what happened, do to the fact that some people just plan don't believe.  Well I could tell them to stick it, because we are not crazy.  I know what we saw. We also would come across some old mines up there, and while at some of those places, you could feel like something was watching you.  I have tried to get back to Plum Creek, but a lot of the roads have been closed off.  What a shame there were so many beautiful places that are tucked deep into those mountains west of Lake Tahoe.  Well I feel kind of silly, but I just feel it was time to share these stories with others who believe.  Please feel free to contact me. I could tell you in person and my Mom and Sisters would also, but Dad is no longer with us.  He could have pointed the locations out on our old maps, just maybe my Mom can, but I can't say for sure.

It was obtained in the remote canyon of Bluff Creek, California, very close to the border of Del Norte County and Humboldt County. Both Patterson and Gimlin lived near Yakima, Washington. Patterson had been trying to obtain film footage of a bigfoot for many years. During the period he had also written a book entitled, \\\"Do Abominable Snowmen of America Really Exist?\\\" He hoped some decent film footage would help answer that question. In this book he calls attention to the unusually large amount of testimonial and circumstantial evidence pointing to the existence of large, forest-dwelling primate species in North America. Bob Gimlin, a highly experienced outdoorsman, was a close friend of Patterson. He accompanied Patterson on several horsepacking expeditions in pursuit of film footage. Equipped with a 16mm hand-held Kodak movie camera, the two set out in October, 1967 for a horsepacking trip in northwest California. Their search focused on the Bluff Creek area, because a number of tracks had been found there in prior years while logging roads were being built. Road construction workers had noticed large human-like footprints on the soft exposed soil of the new roads. The tracks were first reported to the press by . A local newspaper reporter came up with the name \\\"Bigfoot\\\" to describe the maker of the largest tracks. Tracks of six different individuals were repeatedly found on the new logging roads. The sizes ranged from 12.25 inches long to 17 inches long. In the early afternoon of October 20, 1967 as Patterson and Gimlin, on horseback, followed a trail in the creek bottom, they spotted a bigfoot apparently drinking from the creek. Patterson's horse reared in alarm as the bigfoot stood up and began to walk away. Both the horse and Patterson fell to the ground, with Patterson briefly pinned by the fallen horse. Patterson quickly worked himself free and grabbed his hand-held movie camera. While running toward the retreating bigfoot, Patterson shot 24 feet of film. Gimlin sat ready with his rifle in hand. Not wanting another spooked confrontation with this bigfoot, Patterson and Gimlin decided not to pursue it into the forest. At that point they felt they had the footage they came for anyway. After the footage was brought back to town and developed, a handful of investigators from the US and Canada returned to the film site and measured the tracks and other objects to help accurately gauge the size of the figure in the footage. The calculations suggested a height of 7 foot, 3.5 inches. The footprints were 14.5 inches long by 6 inches wide.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Del Norte County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 1563.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"My family and I were heading up north to meet my grandparent for salmon fishing.

I looked to see what she was talking about and I saw a very large hairy creature walking across a wide, dried up creekbed.There were no trees or anything blocking my view. It was a wide open expanse. I did not see its face because I was seeing it from the side. I only saw it on its right side. It was headed in the opposite direction that we were going. To our left I distinctly remember a \\\"watch out for falling rock sign.\\\" I do not know the area there well. I was only camping there for a few days on my way back from Topanga Canyon in L.A. to Oregon where I lived in the Cave Junction area. I will never forget what it looked like. It had long darkish brown hair that covered its entire body. It also had a pronounced crown in the shape of the top of his head. It looked extremely muscular. I was at least 500'away and I'm not real good at judging height anyways, so I don't know how tall it was. It walked with ease across a rocky creekbed.

CA and have heard night screams that sounded like an incredibly loud out-of-control frat party in 1985 when a friend and I were remote camping in a heavily wooded unihabited area around Patrick Creek in Del Norte Co. just north of Humboldt.  There were voices in deep male tonations as well as slightly higher and higher still [juvenile?]  I've heard coyotes, bears wolves etc etc. I've also spent time with my sister who was doing her graduate project in anthropolgy on primates at the San Diego zoo.  The closest I can compare the sounds to were Howler monkeys, but controlled.  The voices almost sounded like a dialect but none I've ever heard; like I could almost make out words.  The sounds were definitely primate in nature though definitely not human. At the time, my wolf-hybrid dog who traveled 300+ miles of the Pacific Crest Trail alone with me and who at the time was a veteran of wilderness encounters and very bold [never would hesitate to tree the largest bear] was trying to bite a hole in the tent to get in.  Once I let the trembling dog in the tent she actually tried to climb inside of my sleeping bag.  She refused to go back outside and remained whimpering in the tent with me until dawn.  At one point in the night, I awoke to hear a very heavy body tramping just outside the tent.  I heard breathing, very deep like in a broad-chested animal.  I dared not go outside until light.  Upon first light I went outside and saw what looked like a stampede had been through our campsite.  The duff was heavily scuffed with signs of foot traffic, which hadn't been there the night before. I've read a few Bigfoot stories and I've noticed that sometimes the sound of children playing has attracted sighting situations.  I once had a problem with a mentally ill person who was sneaking in my horse barn at night and letting the horses out.  After months of frustration and being told I was paranoid, I got a remote camera that had some infrared capabilities.  As expected, I caught the man and turned in a point-blank video to authorities of him.  If your researchers want a good chance at getting Bigfoot on film, why not set up a week-long or so remote campsite with tents etc. and install a infrared video camera to view the camp.  Have recordings or better yet, actual children squealing in play through the hours of the night.  Review the tapes each day and see what you get.  It worked for me.  From the sound of how intelligent the Bigfoot may be, the more 'natural' you make your camp appear as just a family outing, the more likely you'll get what you're after.  That's why I think using real children would work.

We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two malamute cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many backcountry adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \\\"childlike\\\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat. party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning.

Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline.

I suppose I thought he was something the Indians had conjured up. That is how others seemed to think. Then approximately eight years ago, my sister gave me a book to read during a visit in Florida. I think it was called \\\"Mysteries of The Unexplained.\\\" I found it to be an interesting book, especially the story about a creature called \\\"Bigfoot.\\\" I don't remember the details, however, I do remember thinking that there is much more to this so-called myth than meets the eye. Sometime later I saw the famous \\\"Patterson Film\\\". A film of a large, heavy, hairy, bipedal subject quickly walking away from a startled cameraman and his horse. My curiosity at that point had me wanting to find out for myself what the truth was. Was this creature real or just a never-ending series of hoaxes and grossly exaggerated stories? I was in no position at the time to set out on an expedition so I promised myself and a few close friends that someday I would head to the northwest corner of the United States, the reported home of this creature, and answer the question for myself. Years later the opportunity finally presented itself. I started purchasing enough supplies for a thirty day solo expedition into the northwest. Having recently read three books on the subject of Bigfoot, I thought my best bets were either Washington State, Oregon, Northern California or Idaho. Sightings were consistent in and around the large forests of these states. While purchasing supplies, I picked up the August issue of a camping magazine that, as it turned out, contained an article about backpacking in Northern California. The article stated that you are more likely to see a bigfoot in the forests of this region, than another human being. I took the article seriously. Northern California here I come. At this point I had read enough material to have a plan that I was confident would bring me face to face with one of these creatures. My plan was not to go after one. It was to give one the opportunity to come to me. I just had to put myself in itsbackyard. As I made my way into the northwest corner of the state, I realized I wasn't in for a casual stroll through a forest. This forest was thick with undergrowth and either going almost straight up or straight down. One week into my \\\"hike\\\" into the back-country I decided to change my plan. After reflecting on conversations I'd had with the locals, I decided to turn around and head for an area about twenty-five miles from where I was now standing. The people that had talked openly with me about bigfoot activity, all mentioned geographical locations that were in the same general vicinity. They also said that there hadn't been any activity there in the past ten or so years. After making my way to this new location, I met a man that had lived there for the past thirty years. He said pretty much the same thing everyone else said. I had come to the right place but I was about ten years too late. He then pointed to a spot on my map that to the best of his recollection was the area many footprints and sightings had been reported over a decade ago. That would be my final destination. At this point my feeling that a bigfoot was no longer in this immediate area was growing somewhat stronger. I considered the possibility that bigfoots had lived here at one time and now lived elsewhere due to the logging activity in this valley some ten to thirty years ago. The forests of this area are large enough to play hide and seek with the entire U.S. Army. Dense forest covers the land further than the eyes can see and these creatures could be anywhere in it. I pressed on. As I made my way toward my final destination I continued to look for signs of something big and heavy leaving some kind of marks on the earth. If they were still around I should find something. I came across what looked like a bedding area for a creature that could fit a bigfoot's description. It was a bowl like depression in the ground about eight feet in diameter. Everything within this circle was flattened. It was only fifteen feet from a stream. Convenient I thought. There was also what looked like a large print on the side of this bowl headed toward the water. Many small to medium sized trees in the immediate vicinity were bent over or broken off at the base. It all fit, but it could be a bear's resting place, I thought. I left without bothering to take a picture. That same day I followed an old logging road to a point that it turned into a poor excuse for a rabbit trail. Along the way I found three depressions, about 14 inches long and 7 inches wide, in the soft mossy like growth between two old fallen trees. It appeared to be three steps taken by a very large and heavy bipedal animal. Coincidence, I thought, and pushed on. By this time on my trip I had seen several bear, a couple of deer and two mountain. Their tracks were all over the place -- especially bear tracks. Bear excrement was also in great abundance. This put me at ease. The better they were eating the less they would be interested in what I was eating. Blackberries are abundant in August, and from the looks of the scat it appeared the bears were taking full advantage of this. Visibility was usually about ten to fifty yards through the trees. Some of the noises that had been around me on a regular basis were bear and deer that I could not see because of the poor visibility. At the start of this expedition I would reach for the pepper spray at the mere sound of a couple of squirrels playing in the leaves. This behavior was probably due to the fact that a bear had wanted to join me for dinner the very first evening I was in the bush. I'll never forget the sound of him coming towards me through the forest. From that point forward I was well aware that I was carrying approximately forty pounds of bear bait (thirty day food supply) on my back. As my time in the woods progressed so did my ability to guess what animals were around me by the sounds they made in the brush. Given the opportunity, my eyes would usually confirm what my ears had told me. Since I was on foot and usually on a logging road, I sometimes got extremely close to animals before they realized I was there. One time I had walked to within 35 feet of two bear (not on purpose) that were feeding off to the side of the logging road. They never heard, saw or smelled me. Anyway, I reached my destination and made camp at the intersection of four logging roads. It was now almost two weeks into the expedition. My plan was to recon the three logging roads that led down to a river. If I could get to the river I might find some nice fresh bigfoot tracks in the sandy banks along the waters edge. I checked out the east road that evening. No luck. It dead ended about a quarter mile from the river just like the forestry map showed. I went back to camp, ate dinner, set out a chem-light and hit the tent. I put the chem-light out in hopes of deterring bear from casually strolling into my little area of operation. The night passed without incident. I slept like a log. How appropriate. The next morning I checked out the north road. Success, it led right down to a nice open field next to the river. The map I was given by the National Forest Service showed it to dead-end about half a mile short. I'm glad I checked it out. I thoroughly checked the southern bank of the river. No tracks. The northern bank was covered with heavy growth, therefore I did not plan on a crossing to check it out. No tracks and I was sure this was the place that had stirred up much of the controversy some ten to thirty years ago. As I stood in the field and looked back towards the forest, I decided to check all around the field. I started at the west end. Almost immediately after starting this new search pattern I came across a depression similar to the ones I had recently seen but didn't pay too much attention to. Again there was no detail because of the type of ground. It was a bigger and deeper depression than I thought a man or bear could ever make. I looked further and there was another one and then another one. This time I was sure these were tracks because there were about seven of them strung together in the pattern of a natural bipedal walk. I walked in the tracks. The bottom of the depressions were very hard. As though something of great weight had made them the last time this ground was wet. The distance between the steps was not extraordinary, at an average of about three feet apart. I lost the track momentarily over hard ground and then found it again. It was a consistent track. I figured I was tracking him (I say him when in all actuality it may be a her) the opposite direction he was walking judging from the shape of the tracks. It was now time for something to happen that I had never considered or read about in any book. I followed the tracks through a soft section of ground to the base of a fifty foot tall pine tree. At the base of the pine tree was an area of ground that looked as though it had been trampled down repeatedly by this heavy creature. It was at that very instant that I realized he had been leaning against the tree. Then it occured to me that if he was leaning against this bark and sap covered tree, there must be hair stuck to it. I moved may face closer and there it was. From a level of about three to six feet off the ground, hair was stuck in crevices and tree sap. I collected some samples and then stood, in the same place that this creature had stood, with my back against the tree. I couldn't help but notice the nice view of the open field next to the river he might have enjoyed while standing in that position. The surface of my back from my buttocks to the area between my shoulder blades naturally was against the tree. If this creature did not put his head against the tree, as I did not do, then I guessed that I was about 2 feet shorter than the Bigfoot that had rested against this tree. I'm 5'10\\\". After collecting the hair samples from the tree I continued tracking. I had only gone another twenty yards when I found a similar trampled down area at the base of another pine. This pine however was a much younger tree and the top had been broken off at a height of about 6 feet. The top was lying off to the side. As I looked closer I noticed that all of the branches on the side of the tree directly over the trampled down area were either bent back and to the side or broken off. Hair was all over this tree as well. This creature wasn't resting against trees, he was scratching his back! I continued the track and had only gone another 15 or so feet when I found another young pine that was in the same condition as the one I had just inspected. The top had been broken off at about the 6 foot level also. More broken and bent branches with the telltale hair stuck in the bark and sap. This creature had a definite itch. Since I was tracking him backwards, I guessed that he must have tried to rid himself of this itch on the two small trees. They probably weren't sturdy enough to satisfy him so he made his way over to the large pine and finished the job. The tops of the small pines that I found lying on the ground still had a small percentage of green needles with the majority looking brown and dying. I don't know enough about trees to make an educated guess as to how long ago the tops had been broken off. I ventured to guess that it was no longer than a month before I stood in the very same spot. Wow, he had been through here quite recently I thought to myself. For some reason I thought he had just been passing through and was no longer in this area. He had been here but was long gone into another valley. Looking back I am not quite sure why I didn't think he was still around. Maybe it was because I wasn't finding any fresh tracks. I continued tracking him for another three hundred yards or so. He was about as hard to track as an elephant through a corn field. The tracks led to the edge of the thick forest undergrowth at which point I decided to terminate my efforts. Looking back over the area I had tracked, I realized he had stayed just inside the edge of the wood-line the whole way. A smart bigfoot, I thought, unlike the bear and deer that were leaving their tracks all over the place in the wide open field. As I started to circle back around the east end of this large open field next to the river, I came upon a large pile of excrement. It looked human except for the fact it was a very large pile and the contents were plant-like. As I mentioned earlier, I had seen a lot of bear dung and this looked quite different. Tracks led up to and then appeared to straddle this dropping. Again, this was not the best ground for holding a track, however it did look as though the tracks were made by a large, heavy, bipedal ... bigfoot. I collected a large sample of the excrement and put it into a plastic baggy. At this point I was feeling pretty good about what I had found and satisfied that this had been a successful expedition even if I wasn't going to see a bigfoot. I had hair and excrement samples -- good physical evidence that a bigfoot is still roaming these woods. I looked around some more and found two more of the same type of piles fairly close to the first one. I remember thinking this must have been his bathroom. He probably would feed all night, get a drink from the river and then relieve himself here. If this was being done by a bigfoot then he seemed to be a creature of habit. By this time I had been down by the river for a good few hours. I headed back to camp which was located about two miles up the logging road. After dinner I decided to go ahead and recon the west road which was the last logging road I had to check out. It came to a dead end just as the east road had. As I was making my way back to camp, before the mosquitos set in, I noticed something I did not see on my way out. On the north side of this old logging road stood a young pine tree that had been topped at a point about 6 feet above the ground. I immediately looked down at the base of this tree and saw what I knew I would see. The large trampled down area of ground. Those big padded feet had stood right there. I then saw the tracks leading up to the tree as well as the top of the tree lying on the ground off to the side. This time I closely inspected the broken off top of the tree and found hair stuck on it. Hair most likely from the side of the hand that broke it off. I must add at this point that I was keeping a lookout for claw marks in the tracks and teeth marks on the broken off tree tops which would most likely have been left behind if a bear had done this. I was paying attention to this not for myself but for the people that would ask me later about it, when this expedition was done. I had no doubt what was doing this and it wasn't a bear. Anyway, I didn't find a trace of either claw or teeth marks. This time I kept the broken part of this little pine with hair intact in the sap and put it in a plastic baggy. It seemed as though this creature had a habit of preparing these small pines for back scratching posts in an intelligent and consistent manner. I wondered if other bigfoots did this. I completed my journey back to the tent and realized that the pine I had just collected the sample from was only about 100 yards away. If the other depressions I had seen on the way into this area were indeed tracks as I thought they could be, then bigfoot was leaving too much evidence around here to be just passing through. I figured I was camped right smack in the middle of a bigfoot's backyard. I had gathered about three chords of firewood in the course of the day which I now started using to stoke up a pretty good sized camp fire. The wood burned quickly because of the fact it was very old and dry. About every twenty minutes or so, I would have to put on another log. This kept the fire at just under the bonfire setting. Darkness fell without incident. No bears, no mountain lion and no bigfoots. Wow, if my friends could see me now. Bigfoot Bait! Every few minutes or so I would look up the west logging road and then up the east logging road. The north and south avenues of approach were covered by very heavy brush. I could here a lizard coming toward me from either of those directions so I wasn't too concerned about them. Actually it would have to be a pretty large lizard to be heard over the snap, crackle and pop of my camp fire. I passed some time by sharpening the ends of my walking stick. I got a chuckle out of the fact that my walking stick was about three feet longer than the one I had started with. The further away from civilization I got the softer I walked and the bigger the stick I carried. Everything I had read about and heard about bigfoots told me that they are not aggressive unless shot at. Since I had no gun that wasn't a problem, however I did keep the pepper spray ready at all times just in case. I also tried to stay aware of which direction the breeze was blowing because into it the pepper spray had a maximum effective range of only about two feet. I continued to look up and down the two logging roads. My camp site was surrounded by complete darkness. I looked at my watch. It was 11:00pm. If I didn't see anything by 1:00am I would hit the tent for a good night sleep. A bigfoot could be miles from here. Time dragged on as I occasionally looked up and down the two roads. I was sitting on a short log set in an upright position at a distance of about five feet from the fire. My back was to the fire so that it wouldn't impede my vision as I scanned the surrounding darkness. I looked into the darkness of the west road then looked into the darkness of the east road. That is when it happened. The hair on my back and neck stood straight up. It was the strongest instinctive reaction I had ever had in my life. I was looking directly into a pair of eyes that were looking directly at me. I didn't move a muscle. It was a bigfoot. There was no doubt in my mind that what I was looking at was not a bear, mountain lion, owl or a deer. His eyes were set wide apart and well above where I knew the ground should be. I didn't take my eyes off of them. The Omah, as it is called by the local Indians, was watching me. Something that I had not spent much time thinking about, until right at that moment, was now of prime concern to me. Had anyone ever taken a shot at this creature? Did this creature, for whatever reason, hold any sort of grudge against human beings? I hoped not. Actually it was more like a quick prayer. I did not want him to direct any ill will towards me at all. It most likely would have been about 750 pounds of powerful ill will. He wasn't moving. I wasn't moving either, even though my neck was crooked to the left in an uncomfortable position. I watched him and he watched me. The longer I looked into his eyes, the more I got the feeling this was just an intelligent and lonely creature curious to see what I was doing. I began to relax. I had a Mini-Mag flashlight in my left hand and the pepper spray in my right. I wondered if I should shine the flashlight on him to get a look at his body. Again I should point out that this could have been a female, but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to refer to the creature as \\\"he\\\". I opted not to shine the flashlight on him. He came to me, I saw him, and now the ball was back in his court. I waited for him to make the next move. His nocturnal eyes were reflecting the light of the fire I was sitting next to. I tried to make out the outline of his body. I could not. The camp fire illuminated bushes and trees out to a certain distance depending on how recently I had put on a fresh log. Beyond that point of illumination the forest was pitch black. I believe the fire was at a point that a fresh log had just been added when I first looked up and saw Bigfoot. I continued to observe. The right eye (his left), occasionally seemed to fade in and out as though it was partially blocked by a leaf or branch of the bush I was sure he was standing behind. Earlier, at times when I really had the fire going, the front of this bush would be illuminated for the period of time that the fire was brightest. I couldn't see the bush now but I was sure of it's position. As I studied his eyes I got the impression they were wet. Liquidy you might say. An effect probably caused by the flickering of the fire they were reflecting. They were a glossy yellow when I first saw them and faded to a real faint yellow (almost white) toward the end of our staring session. Looking back, I would guess that while paying complete attention to him I had neglected the fire and as the fire lessoned in intensity so did his eyes. Occasionally it looked as though he would blink. His eyes would simultaneously disappear for a fraction of a second. It also looked as though his head was shifting from side to side. Similar, I thought, to what I would do if I was trying to observe someone from behind a bush. His eyes looked to be approximately 4 1/2 to 5 inches apart and almost 1 inch in diameter. Minutes ticked by. My neck was beginning to get sore from the position I was sitting and watching him as he watched me. I casually looked at my watch. It was 12:15am. Then I slowly raised and extended my left arm for the purpose of using my hand as a measuring tool. He didn't move while I did this. He just kept watching. I used the width of my left hand to measure the distance from his eyes to the top of a lone pine silhouette against the night sky in the background. I made a mental note that his eyes were almost directly under and 2 hand widths below the tip of the lone pine. I also made a mental note not to move the log I was sitting on for the rest of the night. I would use this information when the sun came up. After making these observations, I decided to relieve the soreness in my neck and look at him from another position. I slowly spun around in the direction away from him. I didn't want him to think I was getting ready to confront him. I looked up and he was still there watching me. I remember wondering if he could tell if I was watching him. The fire was now slightly behind and to the left of me. From his vantage point, I was most likely silhouette by the fire. His eyes were now getting harder to see. They were there but not as bright. My eyes were getting sore from staring. Then I noticed how dark it was getting in my camp. The fire had barely a flame left to flicker. It didn't take me long to decide that I wasn't going to sit here in complete darkness with a bigfoot just spittin distance away. I slowly stood up to get another log from the pile that was just out of reach. I positioned the log in the fire and sat back down. When I looked up I could not find his eyes. He was gone. At about 3:15am I thought I could see his eyes again but in a position further back from where he had stood the first time. I was kind of expecting him to come back and see what I was up to. It was hard to tell if he did or not, but I think he did. Time passed slowly as I waited for the sun to come up so I could check for tracks. I'd thought about doing it with a flashlight but rejected the idea. I would see things much more clearly in the morning. As the sun came up I sat in the same position I was in when I had measured his eyes from the top of that lone pine tree. According to how everything lined up his eyes would have been centered at the top of the 8 foot bush that stood 70 feet from where I had been sitting. When it was light enough to see the ground fairly well, I made my way over to the area behind the bush. It was an area that was just to the side of the logging road. The ground was similar to the logging road itself which was hard packed gravel. The difference was that the area where I figured a bigfoot should have been standing was covered in a dry, sparse, wheat type of grass. There they were -- the same size tracks I had been finding all along. The tracks were not much more than the grass being squashed, and I do mean flattened, in the shape of a big padded foot. Narrower at one end than the other and approximately 16 inches long and 7 to 8 inches wide at the front of the track. There was a set of tracks leading to a point exactly behind the bush where they then became less distinguishable as though he had been shuffling around. There was however one depression in the ground at a point close to the bush. I guessed it would have been his right foot that made it by its shape. I stood where it looked as though he had stood and found myself directly behind the bush. I looked up to see that if I was about 2 feet taller my eyes would have been at bush-top level. There was another set of tracks that led away at a slightly different angle than the set that led in. He had come in and left on the east logging road. Nice and quiet. No crashing through the forest. At this point I thought to look for a hair sample around the tracks in hopes of later matching it with the samples I already had. I got down on my stomach and looked. Nothing. I quickly looked over the logging road for more tracks but didn't find anything. It was very hard packed. Decision time. Do I stay camped here and hope to see a bigfoot in the daytime? This is when I realized I had taken too many pictures the day before and I didn't have anymore film for the camera. Last time that ever happens. Anyway, Bigfoot is nocturnal and daytime sightings are extremely rare. He would probably be somewhere very well hidden and fast asleep during daytime hours. As I mentioned earlier my plan was to stay thirty days in the bush. But now that I had the hair, excrement and tree samples as well as the pictures of the tracks and the experience of last night. I decided 2 weeks was long enough. I packed everything up and headed out on the east logging road. I was walking at a pretty good pace. Having 17 miles to cover before nightfall with about 60 pounds worth of gear still in my rucksack, I didn't want to waste any time. I'd only gotten about 75 yards up the logging road when I heard what sounded like an extremely large animal thrashing in the woods at a point next to where I was walking. The noise was so close that I didn't think I was going to get the pepper spray I wore on my left forearm out of its holder in time to use it. Then I realized it was running away from me. Crashing through the woods I think best describes it. Large branches snapping as it escaped my nearness. As I listened to it's escape I tried to figure out what it was. It covered a lot of ground very, very quickly. Through the process of elimination I started guessing. The list of possibilities was short because there are not many animals large enough to have possibly made that much noise. The speed suggested a deer but there was no snorting or hoof sounds that I had previously heard from deer running away from me. Nor did the animal in question sound as \\\"fleet-footed\\\" as a deer. The feet were crunching a lot of material underneath them suggesting that they were large surfaced extremities. Could it have been a bear? Possibly, but all the bear I had dealt with to this point were not that afraid of anything. The creature in question was also running away from me on the downhill side of the road and it is my understanding that bear don't run downhill too well. Things happened very quickly, which made it hard to tell, but it also sounded as though the creature I had heard was not getting away from me in a four legged gallop. There is one thing I am sure of. The noise I had heard was caused by an extremely large and powerful creature that desperately did not want to be that close to me. I will venture to guess that my ole buddy had stayed pretty close to me the whole night and may have even been watching for me the next morning. I call him that because I felt as though we had somehow bonded during my long look into his eyes that night by the camp fire. I had seen his soul and it was a kind soul. My question had been answered.

After the fire was burning for about 15 minutes, I kicked it into the fire pit from the grate. At that time my wife got a very strong feeling that we were being watched from behind our camper. She said it seemed to move (the feeling) from behind the trailer, from one end to the other. There were trees, and dense foliage behind the trailer. I started to look around with a flash light to see what it was, and after not finding anything, I started the car and plugged in the 12v spot light. Looking around for about 5 minutes, I thought I saw something move in the distance, behind a tree. This was in the opposite area from the trailer, where no one was camped at all. We both were shaken up, and went inside the trailer for the night. After 10 minutes my wife heard 2 whoops, coming from the area that I thought I saw something move at. She was in bed lying next to the window. I didn't hear the sound. One more thing to add, is that the night before we heard dogs bark in the distance, this night it was all quiet no dogs at all.

During the late summer of 1986 my wife Mary and I were driving east on highway 50 heading toward Lake Tahoe at about 11:30 p.m. We were about 25 to 30 miles west of Lake Tahoe when we approached an S-curve. As we made a right turn, the road curved toward a mountainside and then turned away to the left. While making the right turn however, our headlights were facing the side of a hill and something else, we were not prepared for. About 40 yards directly in front of us, we saw a huge hairy man-like creature walking along the side of this hill at the roadside. Our headlights were directly on it and there was no mistaking what we saw at that distance, as we made the left turn away from the hill the thing disappeared in the darkness. My wife and I stared off ahead, and as we drove a short distance, both turned to look at each other and we said, \\\"Did you see that?\\\" I knew I hadn't imagined it, because she saw it too.

I didn't report this because I thought the park service would think we were nuts, and I new of no other source that would take it seriously. I also didn't think the location of my sighting was one where other sightings had accrued until I used your sightings map. It was April 1993 when I went hiking in Desolation Wilderness with two of my friends for a bachelor weekend. We started out at the Horse Shoe Falls trailhead at Twin Bridges off of HW50 and hiked up to Lake Aloha. It was very hot going up the falls so we were very surprised to se all the snow at the top (that year we had some late snowstorms). We were disappointed because the lake still had a lot of ice on it, but not enough to walk on. We tried to walk around the lake but the deep snow and steep sides male it unappeasable. We set up camp at the south end of the lake 200 yards west of the trail near a picnic bench. We were the only ones up there that fare in except some one that went up the southern slope of eastern mountain. There was no other tracks going around the lake and to my knowledge the back way in was to far to hike in those conditions. Trevor and I woke up early  (near sun up) to try to fish in one of the unfrozen spots near the bank, but it had frozen over that night. We were looking over the lake when we noticed some one on the other side of the lake walking around. We watched him because we didn't think there was a way around the lake and were curious how he got there. That's when it walked by the picnic table across the lake and we noticed that it was a lot larger than we were judging were the table came to on it's leg compared to were our picnic table came to on us (I'm 6ft and Trevor is 6.1ft). That's when we got out the binoculars and took a better look. We couldn't ses any detail of its face but its whole body looked dark brown to black. We were arguing about what we were looking at because we didn't want to believe what were looking at. At first we thought it was a bear but it walk to well on its back feet. We thought it was a hiker but it was not quite walking like a man (judging the long strides by the bench, we could not walk like that comfortley) and how easily it moved across the snow. We went over to the tent to wake up Rob and show him but by the time we got back, he was gone. About 15min. later a lone hiker came down the southern slope of the eastern mountain into our camp and we asked him if he saw any thing on the other side of the lake and he said he watched some thing walking near the lake and then leave out through the north west side. We asked him if he saw any way we could get to that side and he said he could not see a way over. We told him about what we saw and he noticed the same thing (but not the same detail) we did. The sighting was about 10 minutes or so, and has left us a lot to think about. I don't know if it was a Big Foot or not, but after watching the famous video of the Big Foot walking, I noticed that that's the strange way we saw the \\\"thing\\\" moving. \", \"location_details\": \"The north end of Aloha Lake in Desolation Wilderness\", \"county\": \"El Dorado County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 1055: Two hikers have morning sighting in the Desolation Wilderness\", \"latitude\": 38.86, \"longitude\": -120.1358, \"date\": \"1993-04-01\", \"number\": 1055.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qft44pzbv\", \"temperature_high\": 34.7, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": 24.1, \"humidity\": 0.77, \"cloud_cover\": 0.34, \"moon_phase\": 0.32, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"snow\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 8.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 202.0, \"wind_speed\": 11.32, \"location\": \"POINT(-120.1358 38.86)\"}, {\"observed\": null, \"location_details\": \"We where traveling back from the Washoe Indian Reservation, turned on to hwy 50, in dense forest\", \"county\": \"El Dorado County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 919: Car passenger has nighttime sighting near Lake Tahoe\", \"latitude\": 38.93333, \"longitude\": -119.9833, \"date\": \"1996-04-10\", \"number\": 919.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qftmxwg46\", \"temperature_high\": 52.04, \"temperature_mid\": 37.985, \"temperature_low\": 23.93, \"dew_point\": 28.88, \"humidity\": 0.73, \"cloud_cover\": 0.4, \"moon_phase\": 0.74, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy starting in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 8.0, \"visibility\": 9.5, \"wind_bearing\": 230.0, \"wind_speed\": 4.53, \"location\": \"POINT(-119.9833 38.93333)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have recovered a foot print last year (July 17th I believe ).

Desolation is located in the El Dorado National Forest.  To get to the trailhead you take Hwy 50 east out of Placerville and turn off on the Crystal Basin Lakes Road. Follow this road about 20 miles to Loon Lake and the Desolation Wilderness Trail head parking lot. From the trailhead we hiked into Rockbound Lake and camped near the outlet of the lake which goes down to Buck Island Lake. We stayed there for four days. This is a place that we backpack into quite often and are very familiar with the area. We usually set up a base camp at Rockbound and then day hike and fish at several lakes in the area as well as the Rubicon River.  Desolation Wilderness is just west of Lake Tahoe and the Pacific Crest Trail. On our third night there we sitting in camp.  We had fished until dark and it must have been about 9:30 or 10:30PM. It stays lite very late in the summer and we usually fish until dark. At that time we heard a very loud scream that came from the northeast shore of the lake. A few seconds later we heard two more loud screams that came from the same direction. These screams were very loud and not like anything that we had ever heard before. My son and I have both heard mountain lions scream before but these were much louder and very high pitched. We knew that the screams were to loud to be a bird and really didn't know what they were. At that time we didn't even think that it may be a bigfoot. We had both heard about Bigfoot but it wasn't something that came to mind when we heard the screams. Shortly after the screams we went to bed and didn't hear anything else. The next morning I got up just before daylight so we could pack up and hike back to Loon Lake before it got to hot. My son was awake but still in our tent.  At this time we both heard the biggest loudest roar that was nothing like we had ever heard before. This roar came from the south end of the lake. My son quickly got out of the tent and we just started to ask each other what it was when there was another loud roar from across the lake. About ten seconds later there was another loud roar from way up in the Rubicon River canyon which was about 2 miles away. This roar was muffled because of the distance but was still loud enough to hear. About five seconds later there was another loud roar that came from where we had heard the screams the night before. Five seconds later there was a very, very, loud roar that came from about 50 yards or less behind our camp.  At that time my son and I turned and ran over a small hill behind our camp to see if we could see anything. The area behind camp was fairly open with alot of granite and brush and a few trees. At that time we really didn't know what we were looking for but we thought that we might be able to see something. We hiked around the area and over to a snow pond but didn't see or hear anything else. At that time we returned to camp, packed up our stuff and started to hike  back to Loon Lake.  On the hike back we talked quite a bit about what we had heard and were joking that it was probably several bigfoots communicating with each other. I guess we really didn't want to believe that we had heard a bigfoot but we both knew that there is no other animals in the woods that can make the type of screams and roars that we had heard. A few days later I drove back to the El Dorado National Forest Ranger station at Camino, Calif. and asked a couple of employees at the counter if they had ever had anyone report hearing any loud roars or screams in the Desolation Wilderness area. One of the employees told me that someone else had reported hearing some loud screams a few weeks earlier. I then told the employees what my son and I had heard and one of them said it sounds like a bigfoot to me.  They also told me that there was someone at that office who takes reports on possible bigfoot happenings and I left my name and number but never heard from anyone. Over the next couple of years my son and I had told several people about what we had heard but really didn't find anyone else who had heard the same thing.  Most people we talked to had no reason not to believe us but really had no idea how loud the screams and roars were. By this time we both began to believe that we had heard several bigfoots communicating with each other but really had no way to prove it. A friend of mine then told me about the BFRO Wedsite and we logged on and found out that there were other hikers that had reported actually seeing a couple of Bigfoots in the Desolation Wilderness not very far from where we had camped. We talked about submitting a report but never got around to it. A couple of months ago the same friend gave me a video tape of the Discovery Channel show about Bigfoot. When I heard the recordings of Bigfoot screams I knew then that we had heard the exact same thing. The only difference was that the screams we heard were louder.  Probably because we were actually hearing them naturally and not on a tape. About a month later my son was able to view the Bigfoot video and when he heard the screams he said, Dad thats exactly what we heard.  We listened to them several more times  and agreed that we would submit a report. There has never been any doubt in our minds that the screams and roars we heard could not have come from any known animal species that lives in the Sierras. We both wanted to believe we had heard a Bigfoot but really had nothing to compare it to until we heard the screams on the Discovery Channel video tape. My son was raised in the Sierras and I have lived there for 20 years so both of us are quite familiar with the local animals and sounds. I am also a wildlife biologist and know that the sounds we heard could not have come from a bear or mountain lion. We both now believe that the sounds we heard came from several Bigfoot type creatures or at least an animal that has not currently been identified. \", \"location_details\": \"See above report.\", \"county\": \"El Dorado County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 6130: Hikers hear strange screams in the Desolation Wilderness\", \"latitude\": 38.99778, \"longitude\": -120.2392, \"date\": \"2000-07-10\", \"number\": 6130.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9qfmzgk6x9\", \"temperature_high\": 76.95, \"temperature_mid\": 58.955, \"temperature_low\": 40.96, \"dew_point\": 42.78, \"humidity\": 0.62, \"cloud_cover\": 0.13, \"moon_phase\": 0.32, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy starting in the afternoon, continuing until evening.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 10.0, \"wind_bearing\": 258.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.67, \"location\": \"POINT(-120.2392 38.99778)\"}, {\"observed\": \"Well about 2 years ago, I heard strange noises while camping at Suger Pine Campground.

When it saw our vehicle approaching it began to run from the center of the road to the other side into the trees as we passed. The general motion was from right to left heading west to east toward the lake form the campgroud area.  The strange thing was that it was clearly not a bear or any kind of four legged animal. It had a distinkt two legged run as I would expect a human to have, but was covered with hair (or fur) that was much longer than that of other furry animals and had a rust colored hugh to it. It ran slightly bent over and had medium hight (5-6'). It happened too fast to make out special features like feet, hands or the shape of the head. I could only see the running form of the body. The first thing that I thought was that it looked like a big foot, but was hesitant to suggest that to my wife. She in her exitement pointed to it and began to say \\\"look at the bear\\\" but stopped up short. I told her that I didn't look like that to me.  She was the one who suggested that it  really looked more like a Sasquatch, and at that point I know that we had both seen the same thing. A few reflections: 1. I would prefer to believe that it was just a prank by some fun seeking camper, but it was very real. This animal did not run or move as I would expect a human to run or move. What we saw was not a prank. 2. I can't think of a reason why anyone would go to that much work to fool a motorist for no apparent reason. 3.

I went out ahead of him, I got far enough ahead that I couldn't see him when turned to look to see if he was following.  Anyway I stopped to wait for him.

I was really getting scared, I always carry a 44 mag with me, so I figure I can be pretty much safe when I'm out there, but not this time.

I took off, I got about ten feet down the road when my husband pulled up.  He looked at me and said what's up?, you see a snake? So I showed him the tracks. Now my husband is the type of guy that would have to be knocked down by a bigfoot before he would believe.  Then still he would say it was something else. He said that because the road was so dusty that the prints  looked larger then they actually were.  He said he didn't smell anything but a faint smell of something dead.  I wanted to believed him.

I immediately stopped moving to try and see if I could hear any movement.  Then, from the west across the cove, the same sound responded.  The scream from the west continued at least 15 to 20 times.  There were other campsites and I remember seeing someones shadow as they walked to the bathroom.  The screams got louder and the individual hurried to the bathroom letting the door slam behind him.  The screams stopped and did not return.  My wife and two kids slept through the whole thing which surprised me considering how loud the scream was.

I have come to the conclusion that what I saw could only have been an unknown animal such as Sasquatch, as the behavior and curiosity of the animal does not match any animal I am aware of, yet is consistant with Sasquatch descriptions I have read on this and other web sites. I had heard recent reports of black bear sightings becoming more common in the Pollock Pines area and that the bears are extending their range from the Rubicon/Desolation Wilderness area south to Pollock Pines. Two black bears had recently been hit and killed on Highway 50 about 3 miles north of my encounter. All this talk of bears in our area is what led me to initially conclude that what I had seen was a bear. Approximately 5:30am sometime in early fall I was travelling northbound about 45mph on Sly Park road heading toward Highway 50. It was almost completely dark, there was some light starting to become visible, there where no other vehicles. I rounded a sharp corner to the left going downhill when my highbeams hit a large animal on the left side of the road, it was standing on two legs and was facing to the left. It appeared to be grabing at something in the trees in the front yard of a residence. As soon as my light hit the animal it quickly turned 180 degrees to it's right in a twisting motion going down on all fours and proceding to run on all fours to the other side of the road. The right side of the road had thick brush which at that time appeared to be about 3 feet tall. The right side of the road also opens into thick forest land. Upon first seeing the animal I slowed down to about 25mph to be sure this large \\\"bear\\\" got across the road without me hitting it. As I drove past the location where the animal had entered the brush I looked out the passenger window and to my surprise I saw it's face in the brush looking right into the window only a few feet away. I saw large reddish brown eyes, a large brown head and a dull black (not shiny) area that would have been the nose. I did not see ears and since it was looking straight on, I was unable to discern a flat or pronounced snout. In retrospect the face appeared to convey an emotional look of concern or panic. During the encounter I did not consider the animal to be anything other than a bear until several minutes later when I thought it was odd that the animal would cross the road to escape then stop just inside the brush to watch me pass. I would think a Bear would continue to run into the forest. Even with this curious behavior I continued to assume it had been a bear. I was shocked into reconsidering my expanation a few weeks later when road crews cleared the brush away revealing that the brush was growing on a drop off that was 5 feet lower than the road, making the brush 8 feet tall. This would rule out the animal being on all fours while looking into my passenger window. The animal had to have stood up again immidiately after entering the brush to reach the hight required to look into my window, that would place the animal at approximately 8 feet tall. Is it likely that all the behavior I have described can be attributed to a bear, not likely in my opinion.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"El Dorado County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 8595: Man has early morning sighting near Sly Park\", \"latitude\": 38.72139, \"longitude\": -120.5836, \"date\": \"2003-09-01\", \"number\": 8595.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9qfk2118qq\", \"temperature_high\": 92.39, \"temperature_mid\": 77.83, \"temperature_low\": 63.27, \"dew_point\": 41.29, \"humidity\": 0.3, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": 0.18, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Clear throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 0.0, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": 106.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.08, \"location\": \"POINT(-120.5836 38.72139)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I wanted to comment on your report case #8595.

The trout fishing was really incredible and it left a wonderful lasting memory with me. Since moving from the area, I hadn't been there in several years. I talked to a friend of mine about going up and camp overnight and do some stream fishing. He agreed and also invited another friend along for the ride. We got up there in the early afternoon and hiked upstream from Wright's lake and then set up camp. A couple hours later a ranger came by and informed us that we hadn't actually made it into Desolation Wilderness yet, and that we needed to keep hiking for a while. We broke camp and then the 2 guys that were with me, suggested that we go into Placerville and get a room. Apparently they weren't up to camping and fishing after all. I said no thanks and that I wanted to come up here, to come up there and fish, not go party somewhere in town. So they left and I went up the hill farther. The ranger had suggested a great camping and fishing location, but because it was starting to get later in the afternoon, there was no way I would make it all the way before dark. He gave me a general location of where it could be found and what trails to take to get there, but when most of the area is large (football field size) sheets of granite, the trails are only marked with stacks of rocks and they are few and far between. I ended up getting lost a bit, but I could hear the stream flowing over rocks to the north of me. I walked in another half mile or so and located the stream. Below me about 35 feet down a granite cliff was a stream that did have a pool in it, right on the tree line. I thought what a beautiful place that would be to have a campsite and then picked my way down the steep cliff side. I set up my camp directly next to the pool and also with the treeline and some very dense woods about 6 feet away to the north. The pool was on the east side of me. I started fishing as soon as my tent was back up and had a gorgeous finish to a very nice day. Then after it got dark, I climbed into my sleeping bag looking to the east to the Crystal range, I think it is called, and watched as the glow of a full moon worked it's way up over the top of the granite mountains. Once it was over, my day was complete and I decided to go to sleep. That was at 10:30 pm. As I started to drift off to sleep, I heard what can only be described as a very low rumbling growl. When I go into a wilderness area, especially a place I know has bears really thick, I always carry a handgun with me. On this occassion it was a .45 compact. When I heard the growl, it really scared the crap out of me, because it was so close. I jumped up, with my .45 in hand and looked out the top of the screen mesh on the tent. I could see a dark mass about 4 1/2 feet tall, right at the edge of the tree line, 6 feet from my head. I yelled some really loud obscenities and started climbing out of my tent. Once I was clear of the door I brought up my pistol and fired into a dead tree a few feet away from what I thought was a big black bear. As soon as the pistol went off, it turned and ran back into the brush, but it didn't seem to go very far and that concerned me. Bears will usually run like heck and for a long time when they get a shot that close. This seemed to go maybe 50 feet or so into very thick brush. I could hear it thrashing about as it moved deeper into the trees, but then it just stopped. It all went quiet for about 15 minutes or so and then I tried going back to bed. Shortly after I started hearing what sounded like somewhat large rocks, hitting in the water, just above the pool I was camped beside. It would happen every couple of minutes or so. It was the sound of not only the splash, but also of the rock hitting other rocks, submerged in shin deep water. That \\\"cracking\\\" sound. This really concerned me, thinking the \\\"bear\\\" may be circling my campsite and trying to get at me from a different angle. I got out out my tent on several occasions, and was trying to see if I could make out any movement on the other side of the stream but nothing. I usually keep a small flashlight in my tackle box, which I had, but it was one of those small \\\"shake it\\\" and it charges up the cell and lights up for a few minutes. Not much of a flashlight really and worse yet, the handle is clear and so when I would turn it on, the handle would light up too, actually making it harder to see. I had a full moon though and the area is surrounded with stark white granite slabs, and so except in the darkest of the woods, I could see pretty clearly. This went on like this until 2:00 am. That was when I got another \\\"visit\\\". I didn't get to see it, this time, but I heard movement really close to my tent again, same place as the first time, and when I yelled at it, I got a return of something that sounded like an \\\"Ooof\\\" \\\"Ooof\\\", but really deep sounding. I jumped out of my tent again thinking I was going to see it again, but didnt. Still, I put another shot into the dead tree and off it went crashing through the brush again. Again it only went about 50 feet back. There was something odd about the way it sounded when it was running too. I didn't catch what it was though until I listened to the footsteps of a bipedal walking from your site here. It was only on two feet!! It concerned me enough to realize that it didn't sound like a 4 legged animal at the time, but I didn't know what was different until I heard your recordings. Anyway, still thinking I was dealing with a rogue bear, I started trying to figure out what it wanted with me. Was I camped on it's trail to the water? Was it used to finding food in tents? Desolation is a very high traffic place. This particular place was a ways off the trail and it didn't appear to have much in the way of hikers. Hikers usually leave some kind of sign, trash, fish hooks, something to say that they were here before, but this place was very clean. So I decide to take my sleeping bag out of the tent and move over to the middle of this big slab of granite that I am on. There is about a 4 foot tall ledge facing the woods where all the activity was going on. But now the treeline is 50 feet away and not 6. Figuring this would give me some advance warning if I got charged. The rocks kept flying, and I kept trying to sleep with one eye open, hoping the sun would come up soon, and checking my watch all night long. Then \\\"she\\\" showed up. It was 4:40 am and something woke me. I heard movement at the tree line again and I looked to where it all started from. I didn't see anything but then I looked at my tent. Standing right next to my tent was the \\\"creature?\\\". My tent is about 4 feet tall maybe a little less and what I saw was more than twice as tall. At first I couldn't see any features, just the outline. Then it took a couple of steps towards me. I almost pee'd my pants right there. I picked up the .45 and took a shot off to the left of it. It stopped and looked at me. Then it started walking towards me again. It was very fast. I don't mean that it was running, it's just that the steps were so big, the distance was closing very fast. Had it been a bear, I would have shot it immediately, but honestly, I don't think my .45 would have been able to stop it. One shot would definitely not killed it or stopped it in its tracks. Then as it was approaching me, I took another shot, but this one much closer. I could see it very clearly at this point and yes I did pee my pants. The second shot made her stop again, and then she took off running to the northwest through an area of mostly granite slab and dotted with scrub pine. This was the last time I saw her. She ran off out of sight at great speed. I stayed up the rest of the night until it got light enough for me to hike back towards Wrights Lake to the South West. For the remainder of the darkness I pretty much stayed put with the ledge to my back and my gun in my hand, and shaking in my skin. I have not been able to sleep right since then, and for the next couple of months after the incident, I couldn't sleep at all. Everytime I closed my eyes, I would hear the growls and the rocks splashing and then see her coming at me. I would be willing to take someone back up there to show where it happened, but only during daylight hours. I have been a hunter and fisherman most of my life and have seen what I thought, was every animal in the woods at one time or another. Nothing like this has ever shown it's face before, and I hope it never does again. There was another incident however. On December 13th, 1992 up in Snow Mountain Wilderness area, above Elk Creek California.

My visual sighting is at the bottom of this report. I have photos of that I want to send. I enjoy hiking and camping on a regular basis year round. I have been considering submitting a report for my encounter over the last few months and finally I am doing it. My encounter happened about 4 months ago in July. My girlfriend and I were \\\"dispersed camping\\\" (which is where campers can legally set up a tent in the national forest for free for up to 14 days) in El Dorado National Forest off of Hwy 50, about 6 miles east of Bridal Veil Falls. We have a secluded spot we always return to on the bank of a 10-15 foot wide, 4-5 feet deep (at the deepest) river. Some time in the night, probably 1-4 AM, my girlfriend woke me up saying she heard someone jumping into the river about 50 feet away, and it sounded like the person's legs were sloshing against the water the way it would sound if you were walking fast through thigh-deep water. Sure enough, a few seconds after she whispered this to me, I heard the noise too. She was accurate in her description of the sound. I guess my protective instincts kicked in because without hesitation I unzipped the tent with my large mag-light in hand, (the type police officers use) and stood outside my tent, spotlighting the river bank and the forest around us. I saw nothing, so I called out that there were people and please go the other way, still heard nothing. After that we didn't hear any more unusual sounds. What struck me as odd was, why would anyone be walking in FREEZING cold (likely glacier run-off) water in the dark morning hours, not anywhere near any trails, and not anywhere near any roads...? (We had to hike to this spot and it's a mile from our car, down a very steep heavily forested hillside full of underbrush, which is why this spot was so hard to find and it was an accidental find, and why it stays secluded.) It had me pondering for the last few months and even brought me to considering maybe it was a bigfoot because it sounded like two legs, not the way a bear would sound trudging through the water. Plus, there was nothing in the river I could see so whoever or whatever would've had to be farther than we thought and therefor very large to make sound seem so close... The next morning we went for a long hike as it was our last day camping. We had just gotten back to the car when I looked back at the treeline we had just came out of a, sort of, for a last glance, I will miss you, type of look, and I saw what I first thought was a black bear in the very top (the literal tip) of a 60-70 foot pine tree, it was staying still but I could see it was wiggling a little, almost like it was positioning itself comfortably, and it looked like it was hugging the tree like a bear. But then I saw the second \\\"bear\\\" in the SAME spot as this one in a tree right next to it. At this point I'm about 500 feet from these things and the trees they were in. I was able to take many photos of these \\\"bears\\\" and I have them on my phone and will send them to anyone who wants to see. On closer inspection, these were not bears. I showed a few friends and family and they all see what I see, it appears there is a UNIFORM Jet Black sillouette of a large, lean human man. When you see these pictures you will get an off/odd feeling. I know they weren't bears and I know they weren't humans. I'm not sure what they were, but I know what they were not. After viewing them for about a minute my girlfriend began to get a bit worried they might come down, so we left. And we didn't talk about it much as she isn't interested in the subject.

As kids would do we wandered off in the woods and found an old logging road that we decided to walk up.  About 15 minutes up the road we heard a noise in the woods on the other side of the road, we huddled together and waited to see who was there. We saw a creature on the other side, in the trees.  We began to run back down the road and the creature kept pace with us although we knew due to the size it could easely go faster. it stayed in the brush and trees and when it would get ahead of us, it would stop and watch us but never came across the road just followed and watched from across the road. When we reached the center of clearing on Hanson's property we stopped and looked back.  It was no longer there.

My friend and I were bear hunting up in Humboldt County on the Hoopa Indian Reservation. It was in March or April. Back then bear hunting was open all year long in Humboldt County, and there were no limits. We were from Southern California, and were totally unfamiliar with the area. We stopped in a town on the Trinity river, I believe the name of the town may have been Willow Creek, I'm not sure. Anyway we met some Indians in town, and asked them, if they knew of any good places to hunt bear. They said they didn't, but added, that there was an old man in the grocery store who may be able to help us. The Indians pointed to an old blue 1950 Buick parked in front of the store, and told us that the car belonged to the old man, so we waited there until he came out. When he came back to his car, we introduced ourselves, and asked him if he knew of any good places to hunt bear. He told us it was pretty good up on the Hoopa Reservation, and gave us some general directions. We ended up on an old deserted dirt road high in the mountains in my friends dads 1949 (4) door Chevy. We kept going up until we hit snow, started to fishtail, and the right rear wheel went over the side. We set the hand brake and got out of the car to evaluate the situation. We decided to get the bumper jack out of the trunk, and jack the car up, and then push it off of the jack back on the road. The plan worked and all 4 wheels were back on the road. We backed down the road until we came to a place where we could turn around. By now it was dusk, and we decided we had better pitch our tent before it got too dark. At the turn around spot next to the road we saw a big pine tree and decided to set up camp under the tree. By the time we pitched the (4) man umbrella tent it was dark. We put all of our sleeping gear and firearms in the tent and lied down, and were talking for about ten minutes, when we heard the first grunt outside the tent. We both pretended that we didn't hear anything and kept talking. Then it did it again, and this time we both stopped, and I asked my friend if he heard that. He said he did, and also heard it the first time. I said yeah, me too. Now, we both shut up and listened. We could hear it circling the tent, because the ground was covered with bark, and we could hear the bark crunching under its feet. We could also hear its very loud breathing. By the sound of its footsteps and its breathing, we figured whatever this was, it was huge and it was walking on (2) feet. It circled the tent several times, and we decided that one of us should go out and see what it was. Niether of us wanted to go out, because we were scared, so we decided to flip a coin to see which one of us would go. My friend lost. I then suggested that before he went out, it may be wise, to fire the 44 mag out of the tent flap first. He concurred, and stuck the barrel out of the flap and fired 5 shots. We then both went out, he had the 44, and I held the light. We looked all over and didn't see a thing. We went back in the tent, laid down, and were  trying to figure out what had just been outside of the tent. We had never heard of sasquatch. We had been talking for about 5 or 10 minutes when we heard a very loud high pitched scream, that lasted for about 5 seconds, and sounded like it was about 50 to 100 yards away. We looked at each other and asked, what the heck was that? That was one heck of a scream. We talked a little longer and then went to sleep. The rest of the night was un-eventful. We arose the next morning and went outside, and looked around the circumference of the tent for footprints. We couldn't see any, because the ground was covered, with many years accumulation of bark from the huge pine tree we were camped under. We had wondered many times, what it was, that had been outside our tent that night and often talked about it. Then one day several years later, I happened to be in the barber shop, getting a haircut. I picked up an Argosy magazine, and it had the now famous controversial picture of the female sasquatch on the cover. I read the article, and in the article there was a map with an X on it. The X indicated where the picture was supposedly taken. The X on the map wasn't far from where we were camped that night. That's when I made the connection and since then after reading about many encounters I am pretty well convinced that the animal that we had heard outside of our tent 41 years ago was a sasquatch.\", \"location_details\": \"I don't specifically recollect, it has been 41 years ago and I didn't know the area to begin with.

Sometime during the night I was awakened by a huffing sound.  I woke one of the other boys up and we listened to something slowly working its way all around the outside of the cabin.  We woke up the three others and all listened.  Whatever it was outside was poking at the old rotted boards around the bottom of the shack.  We could hear it shuffle around and pry at some of the boards.  Finally it moved around to the front door, which was only about five feet high and Butch got my old .22 rifle and said, \\\"Open the door!\\\"  I did not want to open the door but did anyway.  Whatever it was, was standing right in front of the opening but because it was dark, all we could see were hairy legs.  Butch fired the .22 and this thing screamed and spun around and took off.

My father also grew up there. He was born in Klamath Falls, Oregon, but grew up in the eastern SF Bay Area.  He has a BS in Forestry, A Masters in Zoology, and A PHD in Entomology, and worked as a research scientist with the U.S. Forest Service.  For most of his 20-30 years of service, my father did research on insects that predate timber harvest species in California and Oregon.  When he did his research (usually in the summer and fall) my younger brother and I would accompany him into the woods.  My father was and is a great woodsman, a hunter and fisherman, who taught my brother and myself all about the forests and what types of plants and animals lived there.  My father was also a man of science and this is important to note as will become evident later. At the end of each summer season, my family and some other forestry families would get together and take several weeks of vacation.  Most often, we would load canoes and float down the lower 15-30 miles of the Klamath River to its mouth.  My father and I would fly fish for steelhead in the riffles during mornings and evenings and we would spend the hot hours of the day canoeing, exploring, resting, etc. These trips would often take one to two weeks to complete.  During one of these trips (probably in 1969 or 1970, I was about 8-9 years old I think...) we made camp on the river bar at the mouth of Tek-Tah creek.  There was a good flat bar there, and at that time of year, the creek was flowing under the sand and apeared dry. One afternoon, while everyone else was napping, my father and I took a walk up the creek bed to see if the creek was flowing on the surface somewhere inland.  About two hundred yards upsteream, the creek did come to the surface and flowed sluggishly thruogh a series of large pools. I remember my dad telling me that these pools were probably full of baby salmon and steelhead waitng for fall rains to allow them to swim down to the main river and out to sea.  My dad had a very scientific mind and he would describe natural processes in great detail when we had the patience to listen. As we proceeded inland up the creek, we rounded a bend and entered a long, sandy bar on the east side of a long arching pool in the creek. As I looked across the surface of this bar, I saw a set of tracks in the soft sand. These tracks caught my attention because they were very large, and the space between them seemed very long, like if I laid down next to them, they would almost be further apart than the legth of my body.  The tracks also seemed to sink alot deeper into the sand than the footprints of my dad, who is pretty big (6',2\\\"). The tracks began at the water's edge at the lower end of the bar, and proceeded diagonally across the bar in a straight line to the far end of the bar. My father had never told me any stories about bigfoot  (he would deny the existence of any animal that was \\\"unknown\\\" until science recognized it anyhow) and to my knowledge, I had not heard of any such animal at that time, nor had I any thing more than a passing interest in these types of things then, but these tracks...thier size, gait, and the way they led across the bar in a strieght line...they made a funny impression on me.  My father was also very interested in the tracks, he asked me please not to walk near or in them, then asked me to sit down while he spent several minutes comparing his foot size to them, and trying to match thier spacing by walking next to them.  He seemed very tense, as if he sensed something, or was trying to figure something out.  Eventually, I got bored of sitting and got up and followed him. When I finally caught up with him, we were half-way up the bar.  He had stopped looking at the tracks and was instead looking intently at the timber ahead and at the southern edge of the bar.  He was very quiet and tense.  I have never seen my father frightened or worried about anything before, or since for that matter, but watching him the way he scanned the surrounding forest so intently, made me very nervous and excited.  I broke the silence and began to ask him what he thought made the tracks and what was he trying to see in the trees...He turned around, almost jumping a little in suprise, and told me to be quiet.  then he looked around some more, and started back towards the camp with a qick pace, grabbing me by the hand, and saying these are the tracks of a big bear, son, and we should leave this area alone from now on.  Then he told me not to come up the creek alone, and not to tell Mama or my brother or any of the others anything about what we saw, that it might worry them or something, and that he would speak no more of this matter.  Just like that! Well the older I get the funnier that incident and those tracks seem to me. I have hunted for many years and have seen and tracked many animals in the woods since that time, and have never seen anything like that since.  I am thirty eight now, and my father has retired. I asked my father about this incident last year, and he was silent and pensive for a long time, then he told me that he does'nt remember this time or seeing anything other than bear tracks. I don't know what we really saw that day, but I do know that it scared my dad, and he has never ever spoken to me the way he did on that day, or behaved that way since.\", \"location_details\": \"To get to this place, you must float down the Klamath river from Johnson's Bar (I think that is the name of the place, it is or was as far down river as you could drive on the Karok indian reservation road from the confluence of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers)approx. 1-2 miles to the mouth of Tek-Tah Creek on the southern side of the river. Then you must walk up the bar of Tek-Tah Creek about 1/2 miles or so to a place where the creek canyon curves to the east and the creek itself flowed against a steep curved cliff or hillside. The cliff was about 150 yards long and perhaps 50-100' high. the creek flowed against this cliff and formed a deep (maybe 6-7') arched pool about 100 yards or so long.  On the eastern side of the creek was a large bar made of fine dry sand and some gravel.  This bar was as long as the pool, and was maybe 50yards wide at its largest spot. The creek was flanked on bothe sides by steep and desnse timber and brush.  There may have been some debrees on the bar, but I can't remember (It is strange what you can and cannot remember after so many years...).

Previously that summer we had heard some moanings or low growlings up on the top edge of the property coming from the uncut Bureau of Land Management forest, but did not think much of it. Everybody else got tired of watching the meteor shower (it was spectacular!!!) and went back to the cabin site. I was alone laying on my back in a clearing about 100 yards from camp at about midnight, looking up at the stars and admiring the shower when I had the feeling of another presence. This seems to be a common phrase in these situations but I have to say that this feeling of being watched is something I never felt before or after. Makes you wonder about some sort of a higher lever of consciousness or something similiar (dare I say telepathic?). I got up and cut over to a logging road that went back to camp and was about 20 yards from camp when I heard a rustling off to my right just a few feet away in dense brush. I did not even look to see what it was. I just sprinted the rest of the way back to camp and did not say anything. We were having a good time listening to loud rock and roll music (car stereo with trunk open) and drinking beer when a friend of mine said to me, \\\"Do you smell that ... what is it??\\\" Well ... I had been noticing this odor but had not said anything. It smelled like a cross between an oil refinery (very sulfurish) and had an animal musk smell to it and was VERY VERY strong. I recognized the animal muskiness from my trapping days as a youth, so I told my friend, \\\"This is an animal.\\\" My friend said it smelled like diesel fuel and put out his cigarette it smelled so strong. This smell was so strong that it seemed that it had to be right in front of your face. We figured it was coming from a particular stand of trees and decided to walk up and behind this stand to see if we could still smell it. When we got behind the stand we couldn't smell it but when we got back around down-wind of the stand we heard something take off downhill and down-wind of us. All we saw was swaying brush where it had gone crashing down the mountain side. Some of the guys wanted to chase it but I convinced them that since it had left that we should leave it alone if it left us alone. Well ... in 15 minutes the smell was back. This time everybody in camp grabbed a gun ... we had a lot of guns and decided to chase this smelly thing down. Except for me and 2 others. I just had a flashlight. Well ... they chased this thing out of the aforementioned stand of trees and could hear it and smell it but could not see it. We could hear it stomping and thrashing around behind the stand of trees. They chased it up a narrow trail that led to a spring. I was bringing up the rear but only had the flashlight so I went back to camp with the other 2 that had remained. We could hear the \\\"hunting party\\\" about 50 or 60 yards up this narrow difficult trail yelling \\\"He's right up here ... there he is!!!!\\\" Then the yelling stopped for a few seconds then they started screaming. They came running out of the forest single file screaming in fear. They said the could hear and smell what they were chasing but could not see it and then suddenly there was no sound or smell. At this point they decided that whatever it was had stepped off of the trail and they had run right by it. Well this freaked them out and explains their hasty retreat. It was quiet the rest of the night but a couple of mornings later 2 of the guys were sleeping in a 2-man tent on a hillside above the camp and woke the rest of us at first light, yelling. When we got to the tent we found a huge turd about 18 inches from the front of the tent opening. It was about 4-inches in diameter and about 20 inches long and appeared to be mostly leafy material with some berry seeds. I guess that was his notice to us that he did not appreciate our company!!!

We didn't want to stay at a pay site so we pulled off on a side spur road in dense forest and set up a tent. We had our two Malamute-cross dogs with us who had been by our sides in many back-country adventures. As we set up our sleeping bags in the tent the dogs began growling very menacingly with the hair up full on their backs. We thought there might have been a bear around and worried that they would take off after it and be difficult to catch. We left them outside anyway and crawled into our bags to sleep. Then the dogs began whimpering and trying to claw their way into the tent. We nervously let them in and not long afterwards began to hear howling; first just one voice but then followed by many voices. I would estimate that the sounds came from about 100 yards away. It was reminiscent of hearing a coyote pack or wolf pack but these were not canine voices. They ranged in pitch from \\\"childlike\\\" to adult male and higher female voices. It sounded like a really loud frat party in the middle of nowhere on a stormy blustery night in the dark. It sounded like the people were talking very loud yet howling at the same time. I've had many experiences hearing coyote packs and this was not what I heard. I have no further explanation. We braved through the night and got the heck out of there in the morning. The second \\\"experience\\\" I had at Avenue of the Giants was with the same friend while we were hiking a trail there. It was again the Fall of 1985 about a month later than the first. We had a map with us and decided to cut a loop short by going cross-country through the dense redwood forest. Not long after we got started, the dog we had with us (same as one of the dogs previous) lunged out full on his leash and began dragging my friend up a steep incline.

So I got on my horse and rode down to where I heard the noise and the trail is cut out on an old logging road and a creek crosses through a culvert to the other side of the road and the water forms a small pool before moving on down into the larger creek below. I could not tell you how long I was sitting there on my horse watching this creature not more than 30' away trying to get a drink of water out of the pool. It was a challenge, as the sides to the pool were fairly steep. At first, I thought it was a man, then a monkey, and at last my brain registered what I was looking at! Then I seen the finger nail, and it was black and human like. I was looking at an adolescent, possibly baby Bigfoot! It never had a chance to turn and to look at me, as the horse I was on kept getting more and more upset the longer that I stayed there. I ran back on my horse to my friends and told them in a stuttered manner what I had seen! Just by the way I was acting they knew something was up, because I have been in the woods on horseback almost half of my life. The immeadiately followed me back to the area where I had seen what I described as a young adolescent Bigfoot. My friends did not ever see the creature, but they heard it as it walked away and seen the ferns moving as it rustled through them on its way down the hill to the larger creek. Never heard any sounds from him/her. My friend was going to follow and I cautioned her, because I believe that \\\"Mom\\\" was close by. The crashing in the brush we heard was not made by the adolescent looking creature, it was made by something much larger. The creature was silver-gray, had medium length hair (like a bear), black human like fingernails, human like hands (I seen its thumb), was totally covered in hair from top to bottom (I never got to see its face, it was always looking down). I never have told anyone about the sighting and made my friends promise not to say anything for quite a while. I explained that this was a young animal and to allow me to get this close was inexperience. And if I could get that close on a horse, than someone could get that close with a gun! It was not long after that there was a news report about a son and a father seeing a Bigfoot cross the road near Prarie Creek State Park. The news report was within a couple of weeks of my sighting, but still I kept my sighting to myself!\", \"location_details\": \"On six hour loop trail for equines in the Redwood National Park, Orick\", \"county\": \"Humboldt County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 2998.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"A friend and I were camping and he walked to Founder's Grove.

But, I wanted to catch another steele before the river blew out so, I drove down to the river bar as described in the \\\"Where did it occur?\\\" section of this report. I parked about 30 yards away from the rivers edge, on a dirt road surrounded by dense willows.  I turned off the car and opened the door.  Immediatly I heard two bellows that seemed far off.  I initially thought it was local kids.  The best I can do to discribe the noise is to ask you to try and make it--- put your lips togeather as if to make the sound of a \\\"B\\\" then bellow \\\"Whoooooooop\\\", wait two seconds and do it again. This is what I heard. To this day I can physically emulate the soud. The sound was similar to the bugle of a bull elk.  I used to work as a horse patrol park ranger on the eastern slope of the Rockies in Rocky Mountain National Park, I kept visitors away from the elk.  In addition, I have frequently heard elk bugle near Oric, CA. I know the bugle of an elk.  That's not what this was. Well, I didn't think much of it so I got my wadders on and proceeded to the rivers edge.  I wadded in up to my thigh and began fishing moving slowly down stream.  The river was probably about fifty yards wide and nearly at bank full about ten minutes went by and I noticed a dark figure down stream an accross the river, seemingly standing behind a large root wad.  I could see what I though was a head and shoulders of a bear or something? It was drizzeling and I couldn't focus on it at first, I wasn't sure it was an animal I thought it might just be part of the root wad. As I fished down stream I worked my way dirrectly accross from it and looked at it again, I looked right into its eyes, they were dark, it didn't move. I then saw another to its left, I could see its body from the thigh up, it didn't move, it was looking slightly down stream and I couldn't see its eyes. These things looked taller than a man, had flat faces and large round eyes, their shoulders were broad and their arms were long, they were mostly covered in hair although the one on the left seemed to have bald spots on its chest area, like mange.  They stood still, never once moved.  Ikept fising and tried to work down stream of them to a tailout wher I could cross and sneek up on them to get a closer look, the river was to high. As I worked back upstream I noticed a cacoon shaped object perched on the root wad overhanging the rivers edge.  It was shaped like a foot ball but was probably 4 feet long and 21/2 feet in diameter (hard to tell at 50 yards).  This cacoon like thing appeared to be neetly wrapped in dry grasses like cat tail or pampas grass blades.  I kept fishing moving upstream of them back toward my car, at one point I looked back to get another look anfd the cacoon like thing and the animals were gone.  A day later I drove to the other side of the river to go see if I could track um but the river had flooded the entire area. I don't follow Big Foot stuff, but I do know no bones have ever been found.  As a scintist this encounter has stimulated me to develope a theory.. I theorize that they warn eachother with this BWhooooop sound, and that the reason we have never found their bones is that they cleverly dispose of them by waiting till the rivers are on the rise, packaging the bones, and putting them in the rivers close to their mouths so that they wash out to sea.  I'm not sure I belive in any of this but thats what I saw and heard and thats my theory.  My second theory is that it was an elaborate hoax preformed by somm sort of Big Foot fan club or somthing.  But why would some one do that on an empty river bar I was the only one there and no one knew I was going to be there. \", \"location_details\": \"Glendale Drive in Blue Lake, CA runs parallel to Hwy 299.

Note: Before leaving the truck at the locked Forest Service gate, the Fish Lake Road, and hiking to Fish Lake, we broadcast two calls of each sound, the \\\"scream\\\" and the \\\"howl\\\". Coincidentally, our encounter occurred that same evening. At approximately 9:30 p.m., we were in the process of setting up our second tent (there were six of us in the party), and maintaining the campfire when from directly across the road and meadow we heard a type of \\\"whistle\\\" or double \\\"whoop\\\" (try whistling these syllables \\\"WEEOOOU, WEEOOOU\\\") and it was immediately followed by a very intense \\\"screech\\\", which I could only compare to a bear cub in danger combined with the intensity of a hawk shriek. One of our younger members (15) insists it sounded like a possessed woman! Now, I grew up in the mountains of Montana, am familiar with many animals and their sounds, and have never heard anything like this in my life. And until this moment, I have wondered what it was like to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I have never felt this kind of reaction, I repeat -- NEVER. The sound sequence repeated itself again, followed by a third lone screech. Immediately, we panned the forest/tree line with our flashlights with the intent of at least seeing the reflection of an animal's eyes. NOTHING. We must have lighted the area for nearly ten minutes following the sound and still saw nothing. As time wore on, we began to relax and go about our business of finishing the tent set-up and dinner. Then at about 12:30 a.m. (just past midnight, with two of the teenagers already asleep), we again heard the \\\"whistle - whoop\\\" immediately followed by the \\\"screech\\\", but this time directly BEHIND our camp site up the slope near the picnic areas amongst the trees. Again, we panned the area with lights (I broke out the 2,000,000 candlepower gangbuster spotlight and lit the night ) and still, NOTHING. No movement, no eyes, nothing. After panning around the entire area once again, I noticed movement on the road towards the restrooms and we quickly moved the light in that direction. Walking across the road was a tiny little grey fox, or kit fox. Well, for our needs, that was our mystery animal. (We THOUGHT). We figured it yelped and then made that raucous screech for some other reason. Funny, but that was enough confirmation for us and we went to bed for the night. At approximately 5:30 a.m., three of us woke at the same time and after a minute or two of silence we again heard the \\\"whistle - whoop\\\" followed immediately by the intense \\\"screech\\\" and this followed again by a lone \\\"screech\\\". But, this time the sound was only about 20 feet from our tent as if it was standing directly on the paved road next to our camp site. We were all unnerved somewhat, but agreed it's just that darn kit fox again, and didn't bother to jump out with the video cameras or spotlights. I exchanged words with a person in the other tent (not sure if this \\\"chased\\\" it away), but we then heard the same \\\"whistle\\\" and \\\"screech\\\" again, but far off in the distance as if it were a quarter-mile away. This was the end of our encounter. The following morning we checked the area for any signs of tracks and found nothing. We also nearly walked the entire circumference of the lake shore searching for signs of any kind and [got] nothing. Please note that we did not HEAR any movement in the brush or any footsteps. We did not SEE any movement or eyes of any kind and we did not SMELL anything at all. After hiking out of Fish Lake the next day, and driving back to the coast, we just didn't feel right with our \\\"kit fox\\\" explanation. It just didn't sit right with us. The sound was just too intense. Then, upon discussing the incident with John Freitas that same evening, he agreed with the idea that foxes almost NEVER even make sounds, much less something as nerve-wracking as that of the night before. On our trip back south, we stopped for a break and found a poster-type map discussing the numerous Bigfoot sightings and locations and in the accompanying paragraph it stated that \\\"... sounds associated with bigfoot encounters include whistles and shrieks similar to that of a mountain lion.\\\" We welcome your feedback on discussing these sounds.\", \"location_details\": \"Fish Lake Campground off of Bluff Creek Road; camp site #19\", \"county\": \"Humboldt County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 2859.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"My neighbor is a seasonal wildlife biological technician for Redwood National Park.

This area we were in had a sighting last year around the month of July. The place where we decided to set up was a recent clear-cut that ran along the hillside.   It was about 1000 feet wide and 1200 feet long.   On the edges were fir and oak trees that developed  a thick cover.   Running the width and centered in the clear-cut was a dirt road that the local people and loggers used on a daily basis.   It also provided us with a place to park and set up our sound equipment.   it also became base for our team. From our base, looking down into the valley about two miles we could see the town of Johnson.   From or point we were about 1500 feet above the river and town. Just prior to dusk, I had two members climb to the top of the clear-cut (about 150 feet in elevation and about 300 feet away from base).   I did this so if anything was to come closer to our base camp, they would have the best field of vision, and with their night vision device would be able to determine what it was.   We also had two way potable radios for the upper lookout and base. Manny and myself continued to set up the equipment and waited until nightfall. Because I was scheduled to participate at 10:00 PM in a live broadcast with Jeff Rense \\u201cSightings\\u201d program, I was insuring that my bag cell phone was working properly.   All the equipment checked out other than the phone worked but had some static in the line. At 9:40 we started to broadcast.   The sound traveled very well, and seemed to echo forever.   The location we were at easily helped the sound to travel well over five miles from valley to ridge top, and saddle, it covered a large area.   Very happy with the sound, we continued to broadcast a few more times before the Sightings show started. It was almost 10:00 PM when the phone rang, it was the Sightings show.   The show went fine for the first few minutes, but the static was getting horrendous, cutting Jeff Rense off completely at times.   About ten minutes into this show, Jeff asked me to try and find another location where the reception might be a little better.   A commercial was playing at the time so I quickly contacted the upper team and Manny and told then that I had to move.   I started my vehicle and drove about 600 feet towards the tree line.  I reconnected to the show and was relived that it was a better connection. I was in this new location less than 15 feet to the tree line, with visibility not over 5 feet into the trees.   I was parked for a few minutes and heard what I thought was a bear charging me (I am in a convertible) with the window down, not much protection in anyone\\u2019s mind.     I looked for my revolver and it was gone, I must have forgot it with Manny when I was in a hurry to get into a better location!   I sat there for a second, and again I heard this charging, that sounded like a few feet away from me.   This time I started my car got on the radio and told the upper team that I was moving out because of something charging me in the bush.   (Manny didn\\u2019t have a radio, as we were together at base camp and had to share two, one for base and one for the upper team). I asked the upper team \\u201cdo you see anything\\u201d and they replayed no.   I decided to wait it out, as this thing could expose itself to me (although I just realized that my camera was also with Manny). The show continued on and I would hear footfalls, breaking branches and at least one grunt growl.   I kept asking the upper team if they could see anything and they kept saying no.    I at least had a flashlight, but didn\\u2019t want to use it in fear that I would scare off whatever it was. Obviously I was becoming very concerned for my safety, not knowing what it was.   But I remained there on a chance I might be able to see a Bigfoot or at least see something.   I heard the charging again and again and finally a crackle in the radio  \\u201cJohn it\\u2019s looking right at you, can\\u2019t you see it, it\\u2019s about 25 feet away, that ****** is huge\\u201d.   My heart started pounding FAST, and trying to carry on with this live program without sounding distracted was even harder. The other upper team member confirmed what they were looking at, it was something that was at least 8 feet tall with shoulders that were 4 feet across.   As I sat in my car, cell phone to one ear, and the other to the forest, I could hear it charge again, and that\\u2019s when they would say, \\u201cit went back into the trees\\u201d, this happened several times.  This sighting went on for several minutes, with the Squatch looking at me by moving its body from side to side trying to get a better look through the trees and brush.   It was also observed moving its arms in a quick motion as if signaling to others. This whole incident from the first charge heard to the last tree branch breaking, lasted about 30 minutes.   It was by far the one of the most intense moments in my life. That next day we did search the area and found the soil disturbed where this Squatch was spotted.  Due to the soil condition, it did not allow any prints to be left.   Judging from a tree and stump in the area, it was determined that it was at least eight feet tall but closer to nine feet.   From the Squatches point of view, it had several windows to look at me, and by moving its body from side to side it would have a clear view of my entire vehicle and me.

Our plan was to search the streambed for prints by day and listen and observe at night with 1st Gen. passive IR gear. We conducted about 6 hours surveillance per night, with nothing noted. Site #1: On second day (10? July) I was checking the north side of the streambed about 1/2 mile southeast of our campsite the (Wright Place) when I noticed a flat glade of trees on the south bank and walked across to investigate. After a few minutes in the glade I found a cedar tree with the top twisted off at the 7.5 to 8 foot level. Here the tree was about 2\\\" thick. Most alarming was that the break, and part of the tree where bark was stripped off, looked moist and fresh; probably occurring overnight, given the dry, and warm conditions. The top of the tree, with a few feet of stripped bark was at the tree's base. No hairs found. I took pictures and brought the top back to my brother. Later that day, at a second site (#2) about a mile northwest of our campsite, I found a 50 to70 meter, stretch with over 15 trees similarly broken off at between 4 and 8 feet off the ground. I took a few pictures of these. Over the Labor Day weekend that same year (31 August to 2 September) my wife and I returned to the area. I thoroughly photographed and cataloged the trees at site #2. We also drove a few miles north of #2, dropping down to the creek east off forest service road 13N01. There (#3) we found more tree breaks and a HUGE pile of dried feces; 2\\\"+ thick ropes with numerous undigested seeds and huckleberries. Most significantly it looked nothing like the abundant bear scat in the area, which was generally much less massive, purple/black and under 1\\\" thick. Finally, as we were driving out of our campsite en route home, on forest service road 10NO6, we noticed by the side of the road (#4) a tree that looked like it had been violently twisted years earlier at the 9 to10 foot level and it continued to grow. We took a picture. NOTE: My interest in the Sasquatch started on the 7th of December 1979. I was a 12 yr. old passenger in my parent\\u2019s car, when we saw one.

I had to take a side trip across the mountain to avoid some heavy snow and brush. I found this trail that was going up the mountain, where their were large steps in the trail that were throwing my climbing stride off. At this point, this side of the mountain, that I was on, was bald and it was open ground with no trees or brush close by to hide behind. Suddenly, I had this very bad feeling. Then the hair on the back of my neck stood up straight up!  I never had that happen to me before or since.  I believe this happened for no other reason except fear.  I then left this out of stride trail. Actually, I ran off the trail feeling terrified of something that was coming down this same trail.  I only got a short way off, when I went down on my knees and covered my face and eyes with both hands and tried to hide. At that moment I heard an animal on two legs come down the trail, a few yards from me, it stop and it had to gaze right at me for awhile, then it continued on down the hill.  I didn't look until after it left and continued on down the mountain out of sight. So, I never saw this animal.  I believe this creature was directing a silent feeling toward me, and I complied. At this point in my life, I had been a seasoned mountain man, and have had numerous encounters with many kinds of animals including bears and deer, day and night, but nothing like this. With no more fear I returned to the trail feeling fine. I thought of bigfoot right away. This time I paid close attention to detail.  There was no odor or smell, and the only odd thing was that the trail became fainter, as I continued to climb on up this mountain. I had expected this trail lead to somewhere, like a cave perhaps, but no, it just ended at a small meadow.  I looked all around, and I could see there was a lime stone ridge out-cropping in the distance, but no signs of a cave. This encounter was really something to remember, and it was my experience.

I compared them with my own barefoot track for depth and they were nearly twice as deep. I weigh about 280 lbs. I was surprised that they weren't wider, they were almost narrow for their length. I at first thought they were human because of this.  The best print had 5 very distinct toes and was flat, no arch at all, with toes straighter across than a normal human. It appeared that it had just leisurely walked into the creek. I scoured up and down for an exit point but the terrain wasn't suitable for tracks other than the odd sand bar.

We stopped at the Aikens Creek campground (West of Orleans, CA and just west of Bluff Creek on HWY 96) at approximately 6:00pm, as it was too late to hike in anywhere that evening and the Six Rivers NF website listed it as one of the campgrounds open through November. As we neared the pay station a sign deferred us to render payment directly to the campground host, and as we approached the host's site it became clear that the site was vacant with just a few small items left behind. So, we took the liberty to drive in and explore the portion of the campground that was open. Driving near the Southern edge (nearest to the Klamath river) we smelled a pervasive \\\"skunky\\\" odor, but thought nothing of it at the time. Eventually we pulled into a campsite (second or third from the entrance at the foot of a large hill). Our intent was to get out of the pickup (leaving the dog inside), get on our rain gear and set up the tent as quickly as possible, as it was already quite dark and raining. Just after donning my rain gear, however, I heard some distinct \\\"hoots\\\" from within the woodline which were decidedly not owl-like nor quite human-like, but could be most accurately likened to those of an ape. I asked my friend if he had heard that, but he had not, as he had two hoods pulled up over his head. I quickly scanned the woodline with my head lamp, seeing nothing out of the ordinary through the dark and rain. We began setting-up the tent when I heard it again. \\\"There.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you hear it that time?\\\" \\\"No.\\\" he responded, but he did pull his hoods down. Shortly thereafter we both heard another set of \\\"hoots\\\". \\\"What do you think that is?\\\" he asked. I have had a casual interest in the Sasquatch phenomenon since childhood and find its existence to be scientifically plausible. I am also quite comfortable in the wilderness, having spent much of my life in the outdoors from Alaska to Costa Rica professionally, academically and recreationally, but I never honestly expected to experience anything first-hand with such a creature. So, being educated and reasonable, I declined to respond. As we continued, we began hearing other noises. First we heard \\\"whacking\\\" sounds of wood against wood (more probably stick against tree). Perceiving this \\\"hooting\\\" and \\\"whacking\\\" as a less-than-friendly display, we became a little nervous and contemplated leaving; but curiousity and the dread of packing up, moving to an unplanned location and reconstructing in the dark, while already soaked; compelled us to stay. So, we continued constructing the tent between periodic scans of the area. The \\\"whacking\\\" continued and we noticed it would come from different locations in short sequence (too short for one individual to move from point A to point B). Again my friend asked: \\\"What do you think that is?\\\" I gave the guarded response: \\\"I'll tell you what, I've spent alot of time in the woods and observed alot  of animals, but I've never heard anything like this.\\\" I assume he read through the evasion to the meaning of my response, given the ubiquitous usage of the word \\\"Bigfoot\\\" , and images thereof, in the surrounding communities and some casual conversation we had had on the subject during our drive. Shortly before turning in for the evening, I heard a short series of what sounded like heavy footsteps on the rocky terrain of the hillside, in the rhythm of a two-legged walk. Turn in we did, however, with senses piqued and dog tucked securely within the tent. We slept intermittently and restlessly hearing sounds throughout the night.  Most frequently we heard the \\\"whacking\\\"; most regularly a rather hollow-sounding report originating from a point some distance to our Northeast and up the hill. We would, however, periodically hear closer and clearer \\\"whacks\\\" from varying locacations to our general Southeast; once hearing a disturbingly close and firm \\\"whack\\\" from our South/Southwest. I awoke, once, at approximately 3:00am and heard distinct, single-note \\\"whistles\\\" from the general direction of the distant, hollow \\\"whacking\\\" which were, again, decidedly unbirdlike, yet not quite human. Soon thereafter we were all startled upright by a \\\"crack\\\" followed by loud rockslide, terminating distressingly close to our location. My friend informed me he had heard two other, smaller slides earlier that night. After all was quiet for some time (except the perpetual \\\"whacking\\\") we eventually slumbered down again, awakening to sunlight and (finally) quiet surroundings. In the daylight we observed that the hillside was quite steep, rocky and slightly parabolic in shape, and the rock slide ended up in our South adjacent campsite, leading us to conclude that: 1. Inspection of the hillside would be dangerous and turn up little or nothing in the way of footprints; 2. Sounds could have originated from well up the hill and carried down the \\\"amphitheater\\\" hillside; 3. If it were people playing a prank, they must be extremely dedicated to risk their lives negotiating that hill in the dark and rain and to wait in the woods any given night for the off-chance campers might come by in November; 4. Though rock slides may naturally occur there on occasion, they certainly must not occur on the order of three a night or someone would implement measures to ensure no one camp in that location; 5. Maybe that \\\"skunky\\\" smell we had encountered just previously was not a skunk. At any rate we drove on the next morning to the Willow Creek Ranger's Office (making no mention of the events) to inquire as to open trails. We were instructed that much of the back country road system (and corresponding trails) was closed due to the Port-Orford Cedar Root disease, but that we could drive into the Horse Linto Creek area and hike along the closed roads. We took that advice and spent the next five nights uneventfully. We decided to return to Aikens Creek for the final night (Saturday, Nevember 22)  to take advantage of the open, flat space to dry wet equipment and see if we could observe anything further. We picked an open site midway between the foot of the hill and the highway, layed out equipment for drying, then decided to day-hike somewhere nearby. We drove up Bluff Creek Road to its closure at the road junction to Fish Lake then hiked 1.6 miles down that road.  I payed close attention to the steep clay roadsides, and once noticed what could have been a partial footprint of a large, humanlike foot from the heel (about 4\\\" in width) to a point about 6\\\" forward (and perceivably midway along the length of the foot. I found, however, no other footprints or enough context to draw any real conclusion about the impression. That night, back at the campground, we kept a large campfire and kept some down and dead cedar boughs nearby to throw in for quick brightness if needed. At one point , my dog suddenly barked and charged towards the trees at the edge of the campground just  below the freeway. I halted him and went to investigate, but found nothing unusual. Though better prepared we neither saw nor heard anything further that night. We returned home however with a new awareness.\", \"location_details\": \"Aikens Creek campground, immediately West of Bluff Creek on HWY 96\", \"county\": \"Humboldt County\", \"state\": \"California\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 7452: Campers Hear Unusual Evening Sounds\", \"latitude\": 41.23528, \"longitude\": -123.6581, \"date\": \"2003-11-16\", \"number\": 7452.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9r24d4duvm\", \"temperature_high\": 51.63, \"temperature_mid\": 49.66, \"temperature_low\": 47.69, \"dew_point\": 45.18, \"humidity\": 0.84, \"cloud_cover\": 1.0, \"moon_phase\": 0.74, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0178, \"precip_probability\": 1.0, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1017.86, \"summary\": \"Light rain throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 2.0, \"visibility\": 6.86, \"wind_bearing\": 150.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.28, \"location\": \"POINT(-123.6581 41.235279999999996)\"}, {\"observed\": \"On July 5, 2004, my brother and I went on a sasquatch expedition to the Bluff Creek area of Humboldt County California. The first night we stayed at Onion Lake on Onion Mountain located on forest service road 13NO1. We spent all afternoon setting up camp, takeing pictures and looking around Onion Lake for Sasquatch evidence. Around 9 p.m, just as it got dark, we heard a loud grunt roar down from a hill top just above our camp. The grunt we heard can only be described as something exhaling a great amount of air all at onece. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. My brother turned to me and said,\\\"WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT\\\"? At that moment a deer ran down the hill from the direction of the grunt and into our camp. Then out of the darkness, another grunt roared through the forest from our right at a distance we thought was about 100-150 yards out from our camp. Then we heared a grunt that strait out from our camp that was at least 400-500 yards out. Then we heared the grunt from up on top of the hill again. Then the grunt to our right answered the grunt on top of the hill and then we heared the grunt that was out 400-500 yards answer the grunt on top of the hill and the grunt to our right. It was as if what ever it was makeing these sounds were communicating back and forth to one another. This grunting was very intense for the fist hour or so then it calmed down a little through out the rest of the night. The last grunt we heared was around 5 a.m just before first light. At one time around 10 p.m, we heared a loud grunt come from behind us over by Onion Lake. I turned on my three miliion candle spot light and searched the forest in the direction we heared the grunt but saw nothing. That grunt could not of been no more than 100 yards away from us and was very loud and rough. Around that same time the other grunts seemed to getting closer to our camp as well and we were starting to get scared. We huddled together in the middle of our camp with our rifles and shotguns in hand along with our three million candle spot light in hand ready to take on what ever it was makeing these loud grunts. We were hearing something we had never heard before in the woods and what ever it was, it sounded like it was VERY BIG by the sound of the grunts these things were makeing. We were scared. If it was not for the firearms we took with us we would of thrown all of our camping gear into our vehicle and we would've left a dust cloud a half mile high and twenty miles long as we were getting the heck out of there. We got up the next morning and looked around a little but we did'nt see or hear anything. What ever it was makeing these grunts, they were nocturnal animals and they were only active at night. We could also tell the animals were moveing around in the forest from grunt to grunt. Example: the grunts would get loud and would come from a specific location in the woods and then the next grunt would come from the same general location but a little to the right or left and a little closer or further away than tha grunt before. But we never did hear anything walking through the dry under brush. What ever they were makeing these grunts, they move through the woods very quietly with no sound at all except for their grunts. We packed our camping equipment into our vehicle and we spent the next night down at Louse Camp on Bluff Creek. That night we had no visitors and we returned home to Eureka the next morning. About one month after we returned from our expedition to Onion Lake and Bluff Creek, I was watching a show on the Discovery Channel about Ball Pythons in India. A large fifteen foot snake was crawling on the ground in the jungle as a family of monkeys were going crazy at the sight of the snake. These monkeys looked alot like Chimpanzees but the had black faces and black fur. At one moment, a large male monkey made a loud grunt as he threw a stick at the snake. The grunt was very loud, very rough and only lasted for a second. I came flying off the coutch and said to myself,\\\"thats what we heared at Onion Lake\\\". The grunt the monkey made at the snake on the Discovery Channel was the same tone, roughness, length and sounded exactly like the grunt we heared the night of July 5, 2004 at Onion Lake. The Sasquatch is thought to be a large primate of somekind and my brother and I heared loud grunts comeing out the forest at Onion Lake. These grunts I later heared a monkey make on T.V in India. The monkeys grunts were identical to the grunts we heared at Onion Lake. I'm not a scientist or expert on grunts, but I think this is very interesting. My brother and I were raised here in Humboldt County, California and have lived here in the heart of Bigfoot country all our lives. We have been interested in the Sasquatch/Bigfoot for as long as we can remember and we plan on makeing other Bigfoot expeditions in the future because the sounds we heared comeing out of the woods at Onion Lake on the night of July 5, 2004 makes us wonder even more now about whats really out there.\", \"location_details\": \"At Arcata, California take Highway 299 East.

I was stationed at Beale AFB, Ca., and I would always drive around looking for the next great fishing hole.  I had been driving for quite some time and had decided to pull into Humboldt Redwood State Park.  Being from Alabama, I figured seeing these big redwoods would be kind of cool. So, I got off of Hwy 101 and took the Avenue of the Giants exit.  Driving down the road I was amazed at the size of the trees, so they kind of grabbed my attention. I started seeing a lot of places where I was thinking I could fish, so I started to slow down even more to find a place to park.  As I kept driving the river kind of started getting a little farther away, and I was about to turn around. When out of no where something walked across the road, and to say the least it shocked the you know what out of me.  The reason why it got me a little jumpy was because of the fact that I had to have come within a couple of feet of this thing.  Now I'm a pretty big guy 6' and about 220 Lbs., but what ever walked in front of my truck had to have been over 7 feet tall, due to the height of the truck (Chevy Z71). Now when it comes to the poundage of this thing I would have to say it was well over 350 lbs.  As far as physical features all I saw was the back and arm swing. The thing never turned around for me to get a better look at it.  But it had a large back and rather long arms.  As far as the neck goes it didn\\u2019t really have one.  The animal\\u2019s traps made it look like it didn\\u2019t have a neck.  Kind of like me. But after I did find a place to turn around, I went back to look around, dumb I know, to say the least.

I had been coming to this area for the past couple of months and started to learn it a little better.  So I decided to go exploring for some fishing holes.  All I had with me at the time was a fishing rod and a GPS receiver so I wouldn\\u2019t get lost. I parked the truck and started out on foot. I had talked to two local fishermen about what was in these rivers, and what to use. I\\u2019m from the south and this area was like a new world.  So I made my way down to the river along the side of the bank.  At times the going got a little hard but I managed.  I tried several places but the water was moving too fast, so I thought that I would try and find a slack part of the river, where the flow was a little slower.  Now these woods are a lot different than the ones I was used to, so I was a little excited about this new area. I had been walking for maybe 45 minutes and covered maybe two miles when I saw something in the distance.  At first I thought that it was just a stump, seeing that I had left my glasses in the truck.  Now my vision isn\\u2019t that bad, but I still need them for driving.  But, I started feeling a little uneasy due to an earlier encounter, plus it might have been a bear. But, being the idiot that I am, I had to get closer.  I got to within about 75 yards, because I was using the tree line as cover. That was as close as I wanted to get.  You could say that my heart was beating out of my chest it was like I had buck fever.  Well now that I was within good sight of the creature. It was easy to see what it was.  It finally stood up, and I didn\\u2019t know up until that point how big it really was. Now, I had a roommate who was 6'7\\u201d and this creature would have easily stood over him.  At the best guess I would have to say that it was 7'6\\u201d tall, and it had to weigh over 400lbs.  It finally turned to me and made me out in a second, but when it turned, it didn\\u2019t run away instantly.  It just stood there.  I guess it was trying to see what I was. We must have looked at each other for 10 seconds or so, but it felt like 10 minutes. And in that time all I could see was that the creature had dark reddish brown hair, and the arms easily hung down to the creatures knees. But within an instant something spooked it. The creature turned and looked down river, and it just took off.  Now the ground that this thing covered was amazing.  I didn\\u2019t move for a good bit, because I was in shock.

We were all in the tent and in our bags, the camp had settled down and all of a sudden there was a whoop! They were loud as if behind us, in succession whoop whoop bah-whoop!! And it seemed that there was more than one, I estimate three, one to the left of us, one behind us, and one off in front at a distance.  Also, something either took a large step or jumped off something, and it was big. The one behind us would call first and the one off in the distance would call back. The one to the left would whoop once, but the one behind would whoop three times and the others once or twice. At the start of the whoops would be almost a pucker or click sound. I figure the one behind us was the lead because he would call out and they would answer. After about ten minutes the lead creature started to move off with the one to the left towards the other. I wanted to look out the tent but my youngest was with me who is 6 and was real scared, because the calls were so loud. I stayed with him and did not get to look till it was over. I found no evidence in the morning, but earlier that day I noticed there were markings on a tree that was not made by a bear, almost as if the bark had been picked off.

They had quite a rash of Forest Service signs being ripped down.  If you are familiar with the signs they use they are constructed of massive timbers and quite sturdy.  Some of the signs were over 8 foot off the ground to the top yet they had been torn down with apparent ease.  At first they suspected local teenagers or possibly bears as being responsible.  To make it more difficult for the vandals the Forest Service put a thick layer of grease along the tops of some of the signs.  Within days, one of the signs was again vandalized.  The grease on the top of the damaged sign show a huge human like handprint. A few weeks later we decided to go on a late night cruise in the area where the damage had taken place - just a mile or two below Turquoise Lake west of Leadville.  The dirt road we followed had a steep drop off to a stream on the left.  To the right was a large open sagebrush meadow with thick timber behind.  A large boulder, at least 15 feet tall, was in the middle of the meadow.  We had stopped on the road above the stream and were visiting when we heard something \\\"sloshing\\\" in the water below our vehicle.  When we trained a spotlight on the area, the sloshing stopped, only to start again when the light was turned off.  A few minutes later we spotted a large figure run across the road about 100 yards in front of our headlights.  We also heard heavy footsteps crushing the sagebrush.  We immediately drove to the spot where we had seen the creature and checked for footprints.  Non were found but a trail of mashed sagebrush lead towards the treeline.  We swung the spotlight around the area just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark primate, about 7 - 8 feet tall, cross in front of the aforementioned boulder and disappear into the dense forest behind the meadow.

On this day May 29th 2002 I left the Black Cloud Trailhead at 7:00am solo. I summited Mt. Elbert at 1:45pm. The weather was perfect and unseasonably warm. There must have been very little snow during the winter because there was very little snow left even at summit. I stayed on top for 10 minutes took pictures with my digital camera. My sighting occured around 3:30pm at approximately. 11,500 feet. I was decending and very tired.The trail is not very popular because of its steepness and because it's very rugged in spots. I did not see anyone the whole day. I was traveling on the trail through the only level portion which is a high mountain plateau that lasts maybe 300 yards. The trail hugs an avalanche area to the left and to the right is a pine forest which is moderately dense. As I was walking I heard a fairly high pitched but gutteral cross between a scream and a growl. It must have been heard for miles. I froze in my tracks and unsnapped my holster. I scanned in the direction I thought it originated from but it's hard to tell in the mountains because of echo. I looked to the right first into the forest and saw nothing, then slowly did a 360 scan and now I'm looking back to the forest. At 50 yards I spot the bigfoot. It is standing still facing me approx. 7 feet to 7 1/2 feet tall. I was wearing army camo and I think it had a hard time figuring me out for a few seconds. I was so scared and astonished at what I was looking at I could not move.Then suddenly it turned and ran with a huge stride and it was fast. Its color was black and brown mixed and its fur or hair was thick and matted in spots. It ran like a man except with a slightly haunched upper back and a much bigger and more powerful gait. I lost sight of it in about 10 seconds after it began to run. At this point I pulled my pistol and immediately started cautiously down the trail. My heart was beating so hard I thought it was going to come out of my chest. I could actually hear it beating in my ears.I was no longer tired and the adrenaline was pumping. All the way down the trail I was doing looks over my shoulder and scanning everything. My camera was in my light backpack and I didn't even think about it till I got back to the cabin I rented. I know what I saw and nobody can take that away from me but I didn't dare talk about it until I accidently stumbled upon this website.

The area was heavily forested and had plenty of water. The expedition was well planned and was executed well. The majority of the participants arrived at the initial base camp location on 8 Sept and individual camps (groups of two-three) were positioned along the drainage. We had all been briefed on the history of sightings, tracks, and vocalizations in the area,  and the methods we'd use to determine their presence. We spread out that evening, stayed in touch via walkie talkie, and conducted wood knocking and calling in an coordinated manner. We had night vision devices, recording devices, and IR detection equipment.  We worked well into the early morning hours (2 AM). Nothing was heard.  The next morning (9 Sept) the guides said we should move the base camp to another target area, because we would have heard any sasquatches the night before if they were in that drainage. We drove a few hours to a new location across the Continental Divide. The night of 9 Sept was spent in canyon near the new base camp.  Participants were positioned a half mile to quarter mile intervals (I think) with the sound blaster positioned in the middle of the group. The calls and wood knocks announced and timed so as not to be confused with a response. Nothing was heard. The next day (10 Sept.), the focus moved to a different canyon, near where some possible vocalizations were heard the night before by one of the guides. A group of five or six worked the top of the drainage from well above the timber line and hiked down in the direction of the base camp.  Two others worked the road on ATVs above the valley, and a few others worked the hillsides above the drainage. I hiked up the same drainage starting from the base camp. As I was walking up the trail next to the creek, about a mile or so from camp, I was in radio contact with the group above me. We would announce when we would call or wood knock. We could hear the knocks and calls between us, but just barely. I proceeded to a fork in the trail and found an old hunting camp site that had been used in previous years but had shown no signs of recent use.  I started to take an old trail that went through the camp site when I heard two distinct and clear wood knocks to my left approximately 150 - 200 yards away at most \\u2013 close enough to startle me significantly as I was by my self. I stopped and immediately got on the radio \\u2013 no one was within a mile of two of me and no one had said they were knocking.  The sound was much closer and more distinct that those made by the guys way up on the ridge above me. After about two minutes, I picked up a large stick and made two or three loud wood knocks in reply.  I got an immediate response of two knocks that appeared to be a little farther away (maybe 300-400 yards) but still very clear.  The knocks were similar to the first I had heard but just a little farther away. I responded again with knocks and then a whoop or two over a 30 minute period but got no additional replies.  I was alert to any movement or smells in the area but noticed none. Eventually I decided to return to base camp.  After arriving at camp I linked up with a few other guys. We road ATVs to the location where I heard the knocks to investigate further.  One guy took the ATV further on the trail that forked to the left at the old camp site. He went for about .7 miles in the direction where the sound came from. He later said he noticed a musty smell in that area.  The group that worked the drainage from the top had found a couple of sets of tracks (which they photographed). I saw the pictures and thought they were pretty clear. As they moved down the valley they also noticed a distinct smell about 500 yards to the left of the above referenced wood knock incident. This is the same area where Lee picked up the smell and turned around on the trail. Some things happened later that night around the base camp. I'll let the others describe those incidents.  I recommend that as a prerequisite for attending expeditions, each attendee should listen closely to the Sierra Sounds CD.  I bought it after the trip and wish I had heard it before the trip. It gives a good understanding of what they sound like, the wood knocks, the vocalizations, and all.  The expedition guides from the BFRO were very informative and helpful. They brought a lot of experience to the event. The guides from Colorado had extensive knowledge of the encounters in this area, including some of their own. Other attendees were witnesses from Colorado. I hope to work with the Colorado guides and the other newbies over the next year (may even be up for a trip to Wyoming). I now have a working sound blaster, and a couple of digital trail cams \\u2013 enough to be dangerous.  I hope to attend some of the other expeditions over the next year (Oklahoma, Arizona or Oregon) and work with this group again. My wife thinks I have lost it. I have to get her involved. \", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Lake County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 12904: Notes from the Colorado BFRO Expedition\", \"latitude\": 39.29325, \"longitude\": -106.1215, \"date\": \"2005-09-09\", \"number\": 12904.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9wux91hevb\", \"temperature_high\": 50.69, \"temperature_mid\": 43.885, \"temperature_low\": 37.08, \"dew_point\": 41.35, \"humidity\": 0.91, \"cloud_cover\": 0.77, \"moon_phase\": 0.19, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0032, \"precip_probability\": 0.77, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1010.69, \"summary\": \"Foggy until afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 7.0, \"visibility\": 5.78, \"wind_bearing\": 255.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.78, \"location\": \"POINT(-106.1215 39.29325)\"}, {\"observed\": \"(Job title edited at witness request for privacy).  I am currently on a contract in Rifle Colorado.  My home is 5 1/2 hrs south of Rifle so I stay in my camper 5 days a week.  This morning, I left my home at 0245 as per usual.  I stopped in Buena Vista to fuel up and get a coffee.  As I came thru the little town of Twin Lakes, I was just feeling tired and the more I drove, the sleepier I got.  So before I started up Independence Pass, I thought I would pull over and get some fresh air.  (I had just noted that it was 36 degrees on the truck temp. gauge and even took a picture of it on my phone, to send to my brother in Virginia).  I pulled over to the left side of the road.  As I got out of the truck, I noticed movement in the meadow directly in front of me.  Not more than 3-4 miles below here, I had just seen a buck deer so I was thinking that I had probably flushed another deer.  As I walked to the rear of my truck, I continued to look out in the meadow and that is when I saw this thing move.  At first I thought it was a bear but it rose straight up and that is when I knew it wasn't a bear.  A bear's front legs hang in front of their belly when they stand and these did not.  The \\\"arms\\\" hung to the sides just like a person.  Only if this was a person, he was really tall.  It was furry and a deep brown/red in color. I was so frightened that I thought I would throw up.  As I moved back toward my truck door, it tipped its head back as if it was smelling the air.  When I opened the truck door, it turned, bent over and picked something up and began to run on two legs across the meadow away from me. Not running like sprinting, but running at a pace that he could probably continue for hours. Honestly, the thing that struck me most about this was the way it picked up, whatever it was, and carried it with both hands clasped together in front of its torso. By now I was back in my truck, shaking and tearful. I live in my camper 5 days a week.  I move from State Park to State Park.  I see wildlife daily.  I just saw a black bear Sunday evening and I know what they look like when they stand, how they grunt and grumble.  I know how they lumber and run...this was not a bear.

They were staying in a Log Cabin with one of the family members, and had spent the first few days of thier trip walking the outlying forestry, and going to old mining sites and other places of interest. On the fourth day, they all decided to spend an evening out with a barbeque and invited over a few friends from a travelling show that they know from Iowa. At dusk, my aunt said that two of the travellers (J & S) returned to the barbecue, after hiking up a small valley for about 5 miles. Both were visibly shaken and upset. They told everyone that they had been followed by something at a distance of 30 ft or so for the past few hours, it smelled similar to old, damp caravan interiors and when J had shouted towards the creature, it seemed to back off slightly before violently shaking foliage. This is when they both panicked - as J could see 'fur' as the creature moved, and thought it could've been a bear. My aunt requested that everyone leave just in case the 'bear' had followed J & S back to camp, but due to inebriation most of the group were laughing, and didn't take the story too seriously. At about 10:00pm, a fire was lit, and some of the travellers started juggling firesticks or playing thier instruments. My aunt thinks this may have been a lure, as over the festivities they heard a very loud, very high pitched scream just off the small clearing. One of the more drunken members of the group started walking and shouting towards where the vocalization had eminated - he later stated that he was 'trying to communicate' - when a few of the people at close range saw what was described as 'a very tall, very powerful ape-like creature' moving at first into the clearing, and then away from the camp at great speed. It had long beige hair, approx 6\\\" long, and a dark area around the face and elbows. Everyone left the scene quickly and in panic - J left his very expensive juggling batons and a few other important belongings, so it is clear that they didn't want to stick around. No-one wanted to return the next day to the site, and one of our relatives waited a week before going to look for lost property.

My father was an avid hunter and fisherman. He always had binoculars with him as he liked to look at everything. He was up around Walden, CO and saw what he thought were two bears stalking an elk. I don't know if the elk was part of a herd or was cut out and was alone. Evidently, it did not know it was being stalked. Dad said he was a long way off, he was on one side of a mountain and this was happening across a valley on the side of another mountain in a partly open area. There is heavy timber in part of this area. When he got out his binoculars and started watching, he still thought they were two bears until they started walking. He said they were a brown color and quite large when they stood up and started walking on two legs. He watched them for about five minutes, until they got into some heavy timber. They did not stalk real close together- they had the elk in the middle. He said they were excellent stalkers and would even hide behind a tree for a while. He said he didn't know if they killed the elk or not but thought they probably did. He was sure they were carnivores or they wouldn't have been stalking in this manner. The incident took place in the late afternoon. There were very few people living in the area but who knows, there may still be some of the critters up there.

It was late June and I was on a fishing trip to several lakes and beaver ponds in the area.  I was supposed to be taking a friend along, but he had to cancel at the last minute. I left my camp at Dumont Lake in the morning and headed up the four wheel drive road to the trailhead that leads to Fish Hook Lake and Lost Lake. It is usually possible to drive the three miles to the trailhead, but the road was closed by the Forest Service due to lingering snow drifts, so I had to hike the road. I arrived at Fishook Lake in the late morning and spent a couple of hours fishing and eating lunch.  About 1:30 I left that lake and began to hike to Lost Lake which is only a few hundred yards to the northeast. The trail I was on kind of funnels into the lake, and as the lake came into view I noticed a large, dark  animal about 20 yards to my right near a boulder.  My first thought was that I had suprised a bear, so I froze and waited to see what the animal would do.  It was soon obvious that this animal was not a bear or any other animal I had ever seen.  The animal was standing on two legs and was slightly crouched, it appeared to be staring across the lake.  When it saw me, it fully crouched next to the boulder with its left hand resting on the rock. What I saw is best described as a large, hairy bipedal animal that had features of both a man and an ape. The animal was covered with shiny, dark hair that was approximately 3-4\\\" long and was somewhat shorter in the face area.  The animal was huge and the arms appeared very long as opposed to a person's.  The head was somewhat dome-shaped and was set on massive shoulders, the neck appeared very short.  The animal's eyes appeared below a slightly sloping forehead and there may have been a brow ridge.  The eyes were dark and the nose was flat and wide.  The face was dark and the lips appeared thin. I never saw the animal open its mouth or display teeth. After the animal crouched, it again looked over the lake then back at me.  The animal then stood up and to my relief pivoted away from me and began to walk away from me at an angle.  I moved forward to get a better look and the animal must have heard me move because it began to move quicker and glanced back at me.  The animal walked briskly into the trees and I heard it moving for a couple more seconds then it was out of earshot.  The whole event lasted between 8 and 12 seconds. I realized at this time that this must be the bigfoot of legend, but I had thought that they lived in the Pacific Northwest and were probably a myth, I certainly had never heard any reports of sightings in Colorado.  I briefly thought about following the animal or looking for some good footprints to show the appropriate authorities, but I was alone and the animal was big, I would conservatively guess it was around 7 feet tall and weighed over 300 pounds, so I left and hiked quickly out of the area, not slowing down until I got to my truck. After getting back to camp, I debated about what to do and finally decided the potential ridicule if I reported this to someone and the animal was not found was not worth it.  I watched the media for any unusual reports of bigfoot-type animals in Colorado in the months and years after my sighting and a few reports did indeed trickle in.  I got on the internet to further research the subject and eventually spoke with a BFRO researcher about my encounter and he urged me to submit a report.\", \"location_details\": \"Lost Lake, just north of Rabbit Ears Pass, in the Routt National Forest.\", \"county\": \"Jackson County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 3664: Daytime sighting on the edge of Lost Lake, near the Continental Divide\", \"latitude\": 40.4521, \"longitude\": -106.6535, \"date\": \"1996-06-26\", \"number\": 3664.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"9xhnjh1693\", \"temperature_high\": 72.28, \"temperature_mid\": 57.8, \"temperature_low\": 43.32, \"dew_point\": 39.39, \"humidity\": 0.58, \"cloud_cover\": 0.42, \"moon_phase\": 0.34, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": \"Mostly cloudy throughout the day.\", \"uv_index\": 10.0, \"visibility\": 9.75, \"wind_bearing\": 137.0, \"wind_speed\": 3.83, \"location\": \"POINT(-106.6535 40.4521)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I believe it was in September of 1995 or 1996 and a friend and myself were up elk hunting during archery season.

It was a parcel of Colorado state forest service land that had just recently been opened to hunting. It was aprox. 8:00am and we were moving north through the trees on the east side of a fairly large clear cut. It had just snowed that morning, so our movements were fairly quiet. I was using a diaphram call trying to imitate a cow elk in estrus (a series of higher pitched squeals and mews). As we were moving along I was warching off to our west to see if I could spot any movement in the aspen on the uphill slope on the west side of the clear cut. It was then that I saw movement, a large figure stood up from a short bit of growth. At first I thought that it might be another hunter, but as I looked closer I could see no weapon that it could be hunting with and the size seemed to be to large for a person. I stopped movnig at that point and watched it, it stood and looked in our direction for about 30 seconds and then turned and started walking up into the dense stand of aspen on the hillside. The thing that really sticks in my mind is the way that it swung its whole upper body as it turned to leave, it is almost like it used the momentum from the turning of its upper body to make its whole body turn to leave. At that point I mentioned it to my partner and all he said was that it was probably another hunter, I might mention that he is the type of person that does not believe that anyting out of the ordinary might actually exist. It was only after I mentioned it to him that I raised the binoculars that were hanging around my neck and scanned the hillside for anymore signs of movement. I scanned the hillside for about five minutes and was unable to pick up any movement. We never checked the far side of the meadow where I first saw it because my partner was worried that if we broke out of the trees that we might spook any game that might be in the area. Also because he believed that it was another hunter he did not wish to investigate the area that I had seen it. All I know is that what ever I saw was not a person and was not a bear (I have seen those go up on two legs before), I only know that I am not sure what it was I saw. It was a year or two later and my wife and I were looking at a bigfoot page on the net and found recordings of what is believed to be a bigfoot. When we heard it she mentioned that the sound I make on the call when hunting sounds very similar to the sound that was recorded. I don't if this could have contributed to seeing what I saw or not, maybe it was trying to figure out what we were.

We sat in the sun on the outcropping for about 10 minutes very quietly, enjoying the view and the weather.  We looked down below the cliff and noticed a gentleman riding a mountain bike quickly up the path with headphones in.  As we watched, we heard a very low growl which sounded like a startled exhalation - \\\"Grrrrrrphhhh,\\\" followed immediately by a very different, higher-pitched \\\"Whoooooooop.\\\"  The mountain biker seemed to hear nothing, as the headphones must have been too loud.  The two noises came from the same direction, approximately 30-40 yards below us on the outcropping through thick forest.  We were unable to see any animals, but the sounds were very clear and definitely came from the same animal.  The animal definitely sounded startled by the fast-moving biker. My girlfriend's eyes got very wide, and she whispered to me that she had no idea what kind of animal made that noise.  I responded that she'd say I'm crazy, but that only primates make the \\\"whoop\\\" noise.  We climbed down from the outcropping a few minutes later and searched for whatever made the noise, but were unable to find anything, nor heard any more sounds.  We definitely did not feel threatened in any way.\", \"location_details\": \"Staunton State Park\", \"county\": \"Jefferson County\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 46805: Hikers are startled by unusual sounds in Staunton State Park\", \"latitude\": 39.52701, \"longitude\": -105.4147, \"date\": \"2014-10-11\", \"number\": 46805.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"9xj0c5xme2\", \"temperature_high\": 57.62, \"temperature_mid\": 47.89, \"temperature_low\": 38.16, \"dew_point\": 34.95, \"humidity\": 0.75, \"cloud_cover\": 0.47, \"moon_phase\": 0.62, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1015.32, \"summary\": \"Foggy in the morning.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 7.09, \"wind_bearing\": 259.0, \"wind_speed\": 0.68, \"location\": \"POINT(-105.4147 39.52701)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I've thought about posting my experience here for awhile, but since I was so young, I have faded memories of the event.  Therefore, I wasn't sure it would be so useful.  However, after looking at the BFRO data base for the area, I couldn't help notice the similarities in occurrences, specifically BFRO report 1283.  Also, report 15170 was in the exact same area. I emailed my mother and father about the event a year ago, and I'll edit to protect the names/paraphrase what they had to say about it. In an email, I asked my dad if he remembered the night, remembered throwing a rock in the woods at what we heard, and what exactly happened, here's his response: \\\"I remember that night very, horribly, well...  We had been camping at the very Southern tip of Everglades National Park.  If the same camping area still exists, I think it's now called the \\\"Flamingo Campground.\\\"  Nice name.  If you don't quite recall, here's the link - http://www.nps.gov/archive/ever/visit/camping.htm Anyway, we set up our campsite, and I believe it was on the first night that we chose to do some night-fishing along one of the zillion canals in ENP.  We had the little orange '73 Honda Civic parked on the side of a canal.  As you recall, we heard the leaves rustling s-l-o-w-l-y as something or someone moved back and forth.  Although I don't remember it, I probably did throw a \\\"rock\\\", aka \\\"rock sponge\\\", aka, a piece of uselessly light coral.  Nothing happened, so I shone our huge, massive, bright flashlight with a big 6V batttery right at the source of the sounds.  Of course, the vegetation was too thick for decent light penetration, but NOTHING was revealed.  And, most chilling of all, what/whoever it was, pacing back and forth, continued to pace back and forth in a most non-wild-animal way.  I/we shouted, to no avail, and I got a series of impressive chills down my spine. I said, \\\"Let's get in the car!\\\" and we took off down the little side road while Mom said, \\\"Do you think it was the Skunk Ape?\\\".  I was carrying our surf-casting rod with my hand along the roof of the Civic, and was really, really glad to be out of there.\\\" I then emailed him back and asked him if he smelled anything: \\\"No, I don't remember any smell.  In the cold light of dawn, I thought that it was probably just an armadillo or some other exceptionally stupid animal that didn't know how to be afraid of light at night.  It didn't even stop moving, let alone run away, when I turned on the flashlight and swept it around the area the sounds were coming from.  I remember being so afraid that I didn't think there was time to break down the surf-casting rod, so that's why I carried it with my hand, gripping the roof of the car with the rod against it.  It was the most scared I've been in my adult life.\\\" Here is my mom's response to my original email: \\\"I remember  that  I was sooo scared I didn't even open the car door I shoved you thru the window and you piled in on top of a bunch camping gear,  cooler ect... Dad had to drive backwards  too. I have to say it was one of the most scariest things that has happened to me.\\\" Personally, I remember mostly being terrified as a child, because my parents were.  My dad in particular, is not one to scare easily.  On top of that, he is a lifelong scientist who views all 'strange nature' occurrences with a very stern skeptical eye.  So as an adult, to think back on his fear, and have him admit how scared he was, means that something instinctual kicked and told him to haul butt out of there.  If he thought it was a person, he would have confronted them immediately. I've seen him do exactly that on many occasions.

I was not going to go into the hunting camp, rather decided to hunt along the railroad track bordering the camp along dirt road. We were probably 3 miles deep in a wooded area off main road.  I positioned myself on edge of railroad, with the tracks and very, very thick forrest and swamp bottoms directly in front of me. I had been watching for deer for maybe 30 minutes, when directly in front of me in the thicket maybe 100 feet, sound began to develop.  It was louder than anything I'd ever heard in the wild.  It sounded like a very deep growl/exhale that lasted what seemed like 20 seconds. It happened a second time about a minute later.  This time it sounded closer, but I couldn't see anything in the thicket.  I remember thinking I probably wasn't armed with enough firepower, although I was holding a 30-30 highpower rifle in my hand.  I felt as though whatever was making the noise was big and strong based on the powerful noise I was hearing.  I started walking toward where my friend was parked.  He met me walking the dirt road and picked me up.  I told him what I'd heard; he laughed and made jokes.  We left the area and didn't return until next year to do some scouting in the exact same area. We were without rifles at this time because it was before season started.  When we were walking in the swamp bottom, my friend brought up the incident and laughed some more.  It was no more than 5 minutes later when in front and to the left of us, WE heard the  noise again.  He looked at me like, \\\"What the heck was that?\\\" I said, \\\"That's it, that's it!\\\"  We turned and got out of there very quickly.  When we got to the truck, he now believed me with regard to what I'd heard the year before when we were in that exact area.  We left and started driving the dirt road just looking to see if we could see any deer, or any other wildlife that could be walking that afternoon.  As we drove back by the woodline that we had just exited 10  minutes earlier, we noticed on the woodline bordered by a field, we saw what we thought was a deer grazing at about 100-125 yards.  We stopped the truck to watch. My friend decided he would try to get closer by walking the woodline toward the deer.  As I watched him walk slowly toward the animal, I noticed the animal was moving toward him on all fours.  I told him that it was moving toward him.  He stopped and I think either clapped his hands or yelled something.  At that second, this thing stood straight up on two legs. It was white on the underside and had no distinctive shoulders. It looked as though it had a pointed head and we thought it stood about 7-8 feet.  My friend turned and ran back to the truck. We were both scared enough to leave but before leaving we tried to position the headlights toward the subject for better identification.  But it had entered back into the woodline.

Ron, another friend Rick and I went down the dirt road until we were away from the 4 or 5 houses on the road, and took some time exposures on my tripod.  I noticed a light from a nearby house was still visible, so I moved about 30-50' further down the road; Ron and Rick stayed put.  As I put up the tripod, I noticed a foul stench coming from the woods nearby, on the opposite side of the road from the houses.  I asked Ron & Rick if they smelled anything, and they laughed, thinking I was playing a 'skunk ape' joke on them.  I said I was serious, so they moved towards me.  One said he smelled it, and then Ron said 'I don't hear any crickets chriping.'  I then became aware of the unusual silence.  Ron & Rich immediately turned and ran to the house; I grabbed my tripod & camera and followed.  We go to the house, and before going in agreed to not tell anyone, so they would not make fun of us.  The next morning, B4 breakfast, the 3 of us returned to the area.  We found the exact spot from where the trees blocked the house where the light I had moved to block came from, and there was no smell.  I pointed to an area where I thought the odour had originated, but we could see nothing from the road due to thick underbrush and small trees.  We walked up the road, found a way into the underbrush, and came back to the site.  Rick had stayed on the road to orient us back to the correct area, and when we found him throught the trees, the area directly where I had pointed to as the origin of the smell had a large [@4' x 5x] area of matted -down underbrush.  There was a hill going away from the road, and a small area for runoff between the road and the hill that was damp, and in that damp area, we found a large footprint @1\\\" deep and as I recall about 16-18\\\" long.  Ron, an offensive lineman weighing @275 lbs. barely left an impression next to it, so we knew what had left it was very heavy.  I had B&W film in my camera, left over from the stars shoot, and took a few photos of the footprint.

I know my age at the time seems discouraging, but I know what I saw, and I can recap the whole thing like it had happened yesterday. It was a late evening and my family and I were playing around in the living room of our single wide. I went down the hallway to the back bedroom. That was my bedroom at the time and my brother and I kept our toys in there. We had one smaller window and beneath that is where we kept our toy chest, and in front of it was a chair. I went into the room, sat on my legs in the chair and opened the toy chest. I grabbed all kinds of legos, and after I had grabbed the last lego that I could have possibly held, I sat up straight and there in the window were two piercing red eyes. I just stared at them. My arms let go of the legos and they dropped back into the chest. I stared at those eyes for minute and than ran down the hallway. I had no idea what it could have been. I yelled over and over again that there was a wolf in my window. But my parents just assured me that it was probably the dog next door. Okay, we lived in a mobile home meaning it was on blocks, and no dog, even on their hind legs could peek into the window. That window was set high off the ground. And it wasn't like it was eyes looking from below. These eyes were in the middle of the window, so whatever it was had to have been tall enough to be able to look in. They were like human eyes but not quite. For years I tried to figure out what it might be. I thought maybe an owl..but they have yellow eyes, and there were no trees close enough for a bird or animal to perch on and be that close to the window. I mean, it was right up against the window. It still gives me goosebumps to this day. And this is the same exact story I have been telling since that night for years now.

I love to be out in nature, but frankly, I'm a little freaked out at night. But, nonetheless, I tough it out. Despite my nighttime reservations, I told my husband I wanted a primitive campsite, away from any other campers. We found a gorgeous spot in a primitive camping area that was surrounded by high brush nearly all the way around three sides; the back side faced the woods. We chose this particular site in case other campers moved in. This spot was secluded and private from the adjacent campsites. I have always been an extremely light sleeper, especially when it's night and there are flexible walls between me and the outdoors. I would love to sleep under the stars, but I'm much too chicken. We had brought sodas with us on the trip and were putting the empty cans in a plastic bag that we left laying next to the picnic table. The first night we were there, I was just dozing off when it sounded like something hit the bag of cans pretty hard. I was, immediately, awake shaking my husband, who can sleep through an explosion, and asking him to get up and check it out. He refused and went back to sleep. To the best of my knowledge, this is when I must have become aware of the screams far off in the distance and to the north. I lay there, awake, for the longest time listening to these screams, trying to figure out what they were. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that they must have been about a mile away. They sounded like whomever or whatever they were, was very upset. I lay there for what seemed like hours listening to these screams. They were almost continuous. I told my husband the next day that it sounded like the (extinct) Timucuan Indians were having a war party and were screaming most of the night. I figured their spirits were reenacting a battle or something. It might not have been going on for as long as it seemed, though; when something is disturbing your sleep in the middle of the night, it can seem like forever. Indians fighting was the closest sound I could equate it with, until this evening when I listened to the newest, March 5, recording from the couple camping in Washington. Now, I have heard the Puyallup and Snohomish recordings many times, but never put it together with what I heard that night. The reason is, these earlier recordings are of a single scream, but just as the March recording clip ends, there is a scream which sounds like it is immediately answered by another scream. These 2 screams on top of one another, instantly, clicked in my head. Hearing these screams together were, EXACTLY, like the screams I heard that night. I was never frightened nor did I feel threatened by them. They were too far off, and besides, I never knew a Bigfoot type creature existed in central Florida, at that time. I thought they were exclusive to the Everglades. Only recently, have I found out that they have existed all over Florida. Even though they were far away, they were very distinct to me; as I recall the night was very silent and still. The one thing that helps to calm me at night are the familiar night sounds, but these were absent on this night. By the time I drifted off to sleep the screams were dying down, as well, but had not, completely, stopped. The first thing I did the next morning was listen for the sounds, but they were gone. I thought I might have been imagining them, but hearing this latest recording confirms to me that, maybe, I wasn\\u2019t. However, your website infers that this type of scream/howl seems to be limited to the Pacific Northwest. But I can tell you, I heard these same screams right here in the largest nature preserve in Florida. When you hear something like that, you never forget it, and I will never forget that night or those screams. When I awoke the next morning, I expected to see our bag of cans scattered on the ground, that is how loud the bag of cans rattled, but nothing was disturbed. The cans were, still, all wrapped up in the bag. Nothing else had been disturbed, either. The other thing that has always baffled me about that night was as soon as I spoke to my husband, the cans stopped rattling, and I didn\\u2019t hear another sound, except for the distant screams. I was raised out in the sticks, as it is called, in the foothills of North Carolina, and I know that your average nocturnal critter, raccoons, opossums, etc don\\u2019t just flee at the sound of a quiet human voice. The sound those cans made was much louder than a small animal rooting around, but still, it could have been any average nocturnal animal. I didn\\u2019t look outside the tent, and since I was unaware of the possibility of a Bigfoot creature in the area, it didn't occur to me to check for prints. The next night, after we had gone to bed, a group of young people pulled in to a site about 20 or 30 yards from us and partied until about 2:30 a.m. After they left, I listened but heard no screams, that night. The night sounds were back, so I slept much easier the second night. Other than the partiers the second night, there were no other campers in this campground the entire time we were there. If anyone else had moved in during the night, I would have heard them. But this campground was nearly vacant, except for us, of course. We were, quite possibly, the only campers for, at least, a few miles from this spot. I\\u2019m not saying, for certain, that what I heard, that night, were Bigfoot calls, but now, I have a good explanation for what has mystified me for years. My husband, who is in the military, recently, transferred to the north central part of the state. Soon, we will be moving to the Alachua/Bradford County area. We are hoping to purchase some acreage out in the country. I can\\u2019t wait!

It was New Years Day 2000. There is a state park called Rainbow Springs State Park. I went to the park that morning simply to bird. This is a fairly large state park but only a small fraction of it is open to the public. That morning I wanted to go outside the public areas of that park, just find a trail and keep walking. The ground was white sand and there were no human foot prints anywhere. I remember this distinctly because I was IDing foot prints of animals and insects. I had a pair of binoculars with me and I was looking for birds as I went along. I figured I was about 2 miles into the park when I came to a clearing, and a stand of White pines on the edge of a field of Saw palmettos. The pine closest to the edge of the clearing had a wood duck box mounted on it. I noticed that right away. It made me laugh because the river or nearest water source was over a mile away. I figured a wood duck that used that nest box would have to be desperate. I decided to look at the box through my binoculars hoping I would see a screech owl using it considering I have seen this quite often.  It was then when I noticed something gripping the tree trunk well below the wood duck box. I thought I was seeing things but it was a reddish brown hairy arm. I raised my binocs to get a better look. What I saw still bothers me today. That arm was attached to something that can only be described as a bigfoot. I got a very good look at it. It was hugging the tree its face pressed to the back of the tree outta sight from the front. It would peek out to look at me then pull back. It had grayish black skin around its face. It was pretty much hairless. It had a human like nose, with a slight nose bridge and a nose more typical of people of African decent. It was not like an apes nose at all. They have flat noses with upturned nostrils. You could not see its nostrils. It had no white to its eyes.The eyes where all brown with black pupils. I could see them dart back and forth, very similar to how a terrified or trapped animals eyes look. Its lips were thin and it appeared that they were long for its mouth looked rather big. There was very little hair around the face. It pretty thick on the sides and top of the face/head. I couldnt see any ears. It appeared to have a very short neck with the back of the neck kinda fading into its shoulders. It had a small cone shape to its head It looked very muscular but not blulky. I moved several times to my right and left to get a better look and it moved just like a squirrel does around a tree trying to avoid you. I can't say how long this actually went on but it  had to be several long minutes cause I was busy running thoughts through my head as to what I was seeing. The closest thing I could come up with was this had to be an orangutang. The color may have been right but after that, forget it. I decided to move forward,  just to get a better look I took two steps toward it (it was about 100 yrds away) and it ducked down and ran like hell. I didn't see it as it ran away but it left a sea of moving palmettos in its wake. I didn't make any other noice and I didn't smell anything.\", \"location_details\": \"Rainbow Springs State Park FL.

It was still pretty far away. Three Sundays ago (10/15/00) the dog kept going off, starting around midnight till 2:30am, my husband,C., went out several times with the rifle but never heard or saw anything. At 2:50am the dog went ballistic and C. told me it was my turn. When I opened the front door you could he it over the dog barking. It was all the way back into my property behind the horse lounge ring at the back of the property line. It continued to sound off as my husband was loading the other rifle for me and then it sounded like it killed something, this was awful. When we got outside, we stood behind the truck about 50 yards from where the noises were coming from. Then it stopped but heard no movement in the woods, the dog continued this entire time sounding off. After about 5 minutes of silence, my husband shot off a round into the ground and could hear it break branches as it moved behind that old parts truck in the woods. Then he let off another round and it went farther in the woods and that was it. I called Fish & Game and went through the same old BS I did a couple of years ago. I went to K-Mart and bought a GE auto voice recorder and we started setting it out at night. We got it on tape that same week, we never heard it from inside the house but were able to hear the dog barking. I have let several people listen to it and no one can ID it. Again, this is not like anything that I heard prior or like on those tapes. Last night (10/28/00) we had a party after my art show, two of the people who previously heard the tape were there. We had a fire going for a bar-b-que and we were all pretty loud. At around 10:00pm you could hear it over all the noise in the same general area. They ALL HEARD IT. Except two women that went to get Lotto's at the store. Three male friends and one of their girlfriends were over by the lounge ring where they had parked their car. When we ran over to them, the one guy who had  previously heard the tape said \\\"what the #@!% was that?\\\"  We heard it moving in the woods and we ran in the house for the recorder and the rifles. Total Chaos!! There were no kids present at this time only adults. We listen to it WALK in the woods and you could hear it breaking branches as it moved. One guy said \\\"Its big whatever it is\\\" And another turned to me and said \\\"it sounds as though it's walking on two feet\\\". We never mentioned that from the first experience, but we heard it and it did sound as thought it was two footed. C. went back into the house to get the flashlight and he and R. went into the woods, whatever it was stayed at least 100-200 feet away from them. The whole time R. (ex-law enforcement officer & paramedic) could hear it breaking the branches as it moved through the woods as he guided my husband in the general direction it was moving in, (My husband can't hear certain tones from a far distance) never saw or heard it again.  We also had a Realtor friend, D., and some good ole boys. A good mix of people and no one could ID the sounds, only that whatever it is has an attitude and is big.

The figure did not appear to be carrying anything, like a hiker would.  There is a trail about a mile or two from this area, but the trail crosses the road a good bit south of where we were.

From this distance I first thought this was a bear coming across the road, however I did notice that the way this animal carried himself did not appear to be a bear. The animal was walking on all fours but appeared to be larger in the front of his body but lower in the hind end, much unlike a bear. He seemed to be bobbing up and down and seemed to me that it was injured. As I approached closer I could see that he was walking on the knuckles of his front arms, appearance was dark brown shaggy coat, not like smooth sheen coat or  fur that would be on a Florida black bear. As the animal approached the edge of pavement, he then stood up on it's hind legs with a slight curvature and legs bent, he then crossed the road on its hind legs arms swaying or swinging (longer appearance of arms as that of a primate)as I approach closer to the animal and start to slow my vehicle down, this animal turned its head and glanced partially, (matter of factly). At this point I could tell there were no ears such that a bear would have and knew it definitely was not a Florida black. The upper body was massive and as it went down to the hind quarters got increasing smaller. I would estimate that this animal would be 7ft aprox. weight would be around 400 lbs (my best guess).I could not tell what the hind feet looked like due to the amount of hair but I did note that they were longer than that of a bear. As he neared the edge of opposite side of the road he then returned to walk on all fours and as he entered the edge of the wooded area he stood upright again placing right arm on a pine tree, looked over at me and at this i was at a stand still in my vehicle, I could see a full face. Distance from the animal was 50-60ft away.I could tell that he had more of a round shaped eyes, from this distance they appeared to be dark in color with a lighter color of hair around eyes (short and greyish brown, older in  appearance) same hair color would be around the side of face and what would be the area where the ears would be.

I was living at The Everglades Institue (on Loop Road, across from that old gas station that is where the road used to get really bad). This where the old town of Pinecrest used to be located in the thirties.  Al Capone ran a speakeasy and gambling joint in the area at that time.  I was walking on the path that makes its way around the pond at E.I.  There were five geodesic dome cabins around the pond.  It was just after 10 PM.  My cabin was number three. It was pitch dark out, with no moon, and there was twisted jungle and you can imagine that kind of plant growth if you've been to the Glades. I became aware of something way off to my right of the path I was walking to my cabin I heard scattered footfall noises.  Twigs breaking.  I didn't think anything of it.  There are deer all over the place there, so it was no big deal to me at first. However, when I stopped to listen.  The noises stopped. I would start to walk and they would resume.  Each time I would begin to walk, and the noises resumed BUT MUCH CLOSER EACH TIME. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. DEER DON'T DO THAT!  They prance away, they don't come closer! Now what still amazes me, and what was most peculiar about was happening to me then was:  How can anything move so quickly through that undergrowth,...  I mean, you know, it didn't make sense.  And no person could pull a trick like that, you'd poke your eye out on a sharp branch. After the third time I had stopped,...and resumed walking, the noise was very close. Less than twenty feet away I remembered thinking to myself.  I also had noticed the noises of the footfalls were widely spaced apart,...parallel but yet on an intersecting tract. I yelled at it like you would yell at a rogue dog that was menacing you, all the while walking that much faster,...In a couple seconds I realized this wasn't working and that's when I panicked and ran as fast as I could back the way I had come. It was only 300 feet back to a clearing behind the director's mobile home trailer, and I know I covered the distance faster than any Phys. Ed experience that I might have had in High School but it followed me so closley I could hear its breathing and it was coming from above my head and twenty feet or so in back of me. I never looked behind me, and as I hit the clearing I was sure it was going to take me down. But I guess the light scared it from the trailer at the other end of the clearing.  The field wasn't lit up,...but I became relieved as I became aware it was dropping back,...and at one point it ran back into the woods loudly and the scattered noises it made in the thicket were just a few and then nothing, no sound.I felt it was watching me from just out of sight. I told the director and he went out with his .44 magnum,...and shot off a few rounds. It took an hour for me just to go back outside, so maybe it left while he was dismissing the incident over his theory it was a jaguarundi, or someone's pet cougar that got away, and went wild. Big cats growl, and this thing that breathed like it did was no cat.  This thing was a foot taller than a man because the breathing noises I had heard were definately well above my head and I'm 6 feet tall! What I experienced that night was many, many, many more times frightening,...than you can ever imagine.  My only real regret was that I didn't have a shared experience with a friend who could vouch for what happened. I did not feel this creature is benevolent, or passive like you might read about in other stories.  Maybe that is because the area of the occurrence is close to an overflowing human population that might have disgusted the creature toward man in some way during its life.  Maybe it was wounded, or molested in some way.  I would have to say this \\\"thing\\\" was  definitely NOT friendly!

My husband and I were sitting around the fire and we heard what sounded like something large running and knocking down trees. My husband said, \\\"That was no hog or deer. They dont sound ike that.\\\" We ran inside the house as it got closer to us. Later that week I heard our dog whinning and barking. I looked out the back door window and I saw it. It was standing at the fence line looking in the back yard towards the fire. It was the biggest scarriest thing I've ever seen. I quitely walked away from the window and took my dog with me, in fear that the barking would bring it in closer. I burried my head under my blankets. We told people about it and no one believes us. It seems the fire brings it in. This year we are having fires again already. Late at night about 12-2am sitting by the fires the noises are back. I would love for someone to come and see if they can find this thing. It is very swampy behind us. You can literally get lost back there.

I have been hesitant to contact you over the little stuff but tonight took the cake. It was about 6:30 PM and my husband and I were getting ready to grill some meatloaf.  My husband asked me if I had put corn out for the deer and hog.  I told him \\\"no, why dont you go ahead and do it now\\\".  He went to the shed and as he came out we smelt the worst of smells. It was like something was dead like a swamp rat. He asked me do you smell that, I was like oh my God yes, it stinks really bad.  He told me go get my gun. I ran in the house and got the 38 special that we keep.  I brought the gun to him.  I went in the house to get my shoes and by the time I came back out there were three large knocks or bangs on the side of the shed.  He dropped the corn and turned toward the shed and trees and backed out of the area really fast.  He said, \\\"Steph, you know I dont scare eaily, but that scared me so bad it made my hair stand up on ends.\\\"  Well we looked around and didnt see anything but we didnt go behind the shed because it is wooded against it.

It sounded as if it was shuffling along in the gravel or something and breathing funny.  Then eventually all you could hear were the branches breaking. I had been wondering why the hog and deer hadnt been coming in, would that be the case? My son, I and my dad prior to all of this had been sitting outside enjoying the cool night when we heard noises. We quit talking and listened. It was faint howls and knocks. This lasted from about 8 to 11 Pm. Also, there have been a few other incidents of smells and sights here.  My dad was staying here for a few months and he went to walk his dog like any other night.  Well Zeus wouldnt go, so he dragged him.  No sooner he got around back of the camper trailer he said he saw him.  He said Zeus bout ripped his arm off trying to get back into the trailer. Another time my 2-year-old was playing just off of the steps. I was inside sitting in my chair so that I could see him.  When all of a sudden he screamed at the top of his lungs and about killed hisself trying to run up the steps and get into the house. On the way up all he kept screaming is monster.  He knows the difference a deer and a hog, after all he sees them all the time.  To this day you cannot get him to go off the porch by hisself and he afraid of the fence line. You see we have about 7 acres of swamp behind us that we own.  Our whole neighborhood has a lot of swamp and lakes.  I want to venture into the swamp with someone to see if I can find anything.  I know he's out here it is just a matter of time. I have spoken to one of my neighbors about any strange sitings and she said she has had one, but she dont talk about it because everyone thought that she was crazy. She told me about it.  She said she had gone outside just after dark to go to the nieghbors house at the time and there he was standing across the neighbor's driveway across the street.

Though I tend to hunt more than one Wildlife Management Area each year the Green Swamp WMA is a go-to area for me. I have spent possibly a thousand days in the Green Swamp over the last 35 years. I am very familiar with terrain and all of the plants, insects, and wildlife in the area. I have a demanding job that makes it difficult to coordinate a hunt with friends, so for the last 30 or so years I have hunted alone. I have walked in and out of different hunt locations in the dark hundreds of times and have never seen or heard anything that alarmed me. In about 2010 a new tract of land was added and opened to hunters in Green Swamp. The tract is about 1000 acres of planted pines that are about 15 years old, trunks about 10 inches in diameter, and clear of branches up to about 7 feet. The planted pines are about 15 feet apart and are planted in rows, each row is also about 15 feet apart. There is a heavy layer of pine straw so very little low vegetation is present. It is possible to see for hundreds of yards down each row, but visibility to each side across the rows is limited to about 50 yards. The pines are planted between natural cypress swamps, and a few small ponds. Access is limited to foot traffic only and there is only one way in and one way out. Hunting this area requires a lot of walking. I will often take a vacation in January and hunt for the better part of the week in the Green Swamp before the season closes. After the Christmas holidays the woods are quiet with few if any hunters. During the week it is not uncommon for there to be fewer than 10 hunters in the entire 55,000 acre WMA. In mid January of 2012 I had taken a vacation to hunt this area. This was my second year hunting the new area. It was mid week, there were no other vehicles parked at the entrance to this area, the weather was cool and clear. I was using a large garden cart of the type sold at Tractor Supply to haul in a heavy climbing treestand, that would also be used to haul out a deer or hog if required. I had hunted the edge of a swamp that morning and at mid day I decided to take down my stand and move to another location. I loaded up my cart and was pulling it along, rifle in hand, down one of the long rows of pines. I got to a location that the visibility down the row looking due west was exceptional, so I took a break, but was still actively hunting game that might cross this row. I set my backpack as a rifle rest and lay prone, my line of fire was west down the row. I am in full camo, with no face covering. My garden cart is an unnatural bright green with silver painted wheels, with treestand on top, probably about 40 inches in height overall. It was between 2pm and 3pm, bright but indirect sunlight through the young pines. I had been there for a few minutes and had been checking for work e-mails on my phone, when I caught motion to my left. I looked up and there were 3 big dudes in black ghille suits no more than 10 yards away from me walking in single file quartering away crossing my line of fire. I laid there surprised but motionless and let them pass. They walked in a NNW direction for about 50 or 60 yards into a cypress swamp, before I lost sight of them. Shortly after they walked out of sight they started banging around in the swamp, loudly. The banging sounded almost metallic, a dull \\u201cdonk\\u201d like hollow aluminum against a tree. I thought these idiots were very loudly and carelessly taking their tree stands down. There were possibly 20 bangs. I got frustrated that these guys had ruined my hunt and stood up, got situated and began to head west with my cart once again. As I crossed their path I noticed a distinct game trail that they had used. I continued on and hunted that evening and the rest of the week in the area. I had my phone/camera in my hand while I watched them walk closely by, I had no fear or reason to take a picture or a video because it never crossed my mind that I was seeing anything but foolish hunters. They were walking rapidly but quietly, they walked fully upright with human posture, normal armswing. Narrow at the waist and broad across the back. They appeared to be 3 physically fit tall young hunters in unusual black gille suits. They were big but not alarmingly big. All 3 were identical size and shape. Maybe 6\\u20194\\u201d to 6\\u20196\\u201d, 250lbs. I did not notice an odor. Because they were quartering away I did not see or for that matter even look for any facial features. Three big dudes in black gillie suits with no hunter orange, no rifles, no gear walk directly in front of my loaded rifle, and me and my big ugly wagon are close, in the open, and in plain sight. I told my buddies at work about it, they suggested that it might be Fish and Game Commission trying to catch poachers. For two years something just didn\\u2019t seem right about the whole incident. The more I thought about it the more unanswered questions I had. Unanswered Questions: \\u2022\\tThey walked about 10 yards from me, in very good light, me and my wagon were very conspicuous. I was motionless but how could a person much less 3 people not see me out in this open terrain? \\u2022\\tThey walked in front of another hunter with a loaded rifle. No hunter would do that. \\u2022\\tThey had no gear, no vests, no hunting weapons, they were carrying nothing. If they were not hunting, were they hunters? \\u2022\\tBlack gillie suits, I have a green one and a tan one, have never worn either while hunting because they snag on everything. Why would someone wear a black gillie suit in a green environment? \\u2022\\tIf 3 hunters decided to hunt in gillie suits they would probably be green and would likely be different from one another, these were all exactly the same. \\u2022\\tGillie suits are usually and on purpose very asymmetrical, often baggy and droopy with rows of material sewn on. These were form fitting and uniformly 3 or 4 inches in length, I would describe as looking like wet hair. \\u2022\\tThe banging noise. About a year ago on a Saturday I was watching River Monsters, Swamp People and one of the Bigfoot shows. It dawned on me that the banging around might have been tree knocks. Until watching that show 2 years after the incident I had never heard about tree knocks, so I had not previously made the connection, and that it when I began to wonder whether I had actually seen something other than hunters that day.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Polk County\", \"state\": \"Florida\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 51800.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"Well where do I start. Oddly enough, here, at my last resort. Let me please start off with the whole I'm not crazy speech. I live here in Central Florida and work as a Deputy Sheriff for the past 16 years. Add to that my time in the military and being some what of a hunter and one could say I have spent a good bit of time in the woods and around the world. However about 1.5 years ago myself and a friend (with a similar background) heard something while hog hunting at night that to this day rattled my very being. The location was near Lake Hatchineha in the Poinciana area of Polk County. The time was close to 2am. We were still hunting in an open area with a heavy woodline between us and the lake. What we both heard is difficult to describe since I had only ever heard a similar sound in a movie. Yep a movie, and excluding that in my four decades of life and travel I have never heard anything remotely close. It was not a whoop or a howl or a cry but what I can only describe as a chuffing noise. Now if you want to listen to the only thing that I have been able to find that comes close, watch Jurassic Park and when the raptors call to each other, that's it. But here is where that similarity ends. The sound was much deeper and had a slight rumble at the end. From our position it sounded at least 1/4 -1/2 mile away. The noise was made four times like (chuff-chuff-chuff-chuff)  then complete silence and by that I mean not even the birds were chirping.  Both my buddy and I had that whole hair on the back of the neck thing going on big time. What set our nerves on overdrive was after about  an hour later we heard it again. This time it was to our north and only about 50 yards away. Needless to say it was much louder as in I honestly felt it in my chest. What ever it was it was big and moving our way in the tree line. We could hear it moving slowly to the west and it did not sound like a deer, bear, or any of the many other animals I have heard or tracked ever. I will say this. I do not scare easily. I have been alone in deep woods in the green swamp and never had a second thought. But that night I have not and will not ever forget. We hunted the rest of the night back to back literally. Now I assume your wondering why am I writing this here. Well in truth I have searched every site on strange noises with no luck. I have spoken to countless others about it with no luck and got in touch with my buddies at FWC with no luck. Am I a believer? Well my thought is simple - why cant they exist? Did we hear one that night? I have no clue. I am making contact with you because as I stated earlier this seems like my last resort. Maybe you or someone has heard the same thing and can identify the animal. If you actually have or just need to Q&A me I can be contacted by email or phone Thank you for your time.\", \"location_details\": \"Location was and undeveloped area north of Rock Drive.

Our neighborhood borders a series of orange, grapefruit and tangerine groves that are all adjacent to landfill and mining property.  Around 7:30 pm my daughter asked, as she does typically, \\\"dad, lets go look at the pigs\\\". About three to four times a week we ride these groves on our four wheeler and survey for wild animals. We've seen bobcat, coyote and pigs. In the past two and a half months we have been following a family of pigs which when we first sighted them had around 15 piglets about a month old. So we have been spotting them to see the growth of the piglets who are about 40 lbs now. After making our normal rounds around a few sections of groves we had not spotted the family. After riding slot down one of the main grove roads she spotted a big boar and we kept moving. The four wheeler was giving us some problems so I ran up through the gears to maybe clean the carb a little which put us about a quarter of a mile down this main road further back into the groves. We then turned around and returned to the spot where she had seen the big boar, well a few rows of trees short, where we slowed our pace to view this pig. Sure enough he was there. Three rows of trees past this location was the intersection of another heavily traveled grove road where we slowed down and turned the four wheeler off to listen for any more pigs. Just after shutting the four wheeler off a smaller boar crossed the adjacent main road....and then another, another and another. Three boars crossed. Immediately after seeing the boars, in the opposite direction we both heard four simultaneous noises. Now I consider myself an avid outdoorsman, hunting small and large game and also fishing for the last 25 years. I've seen and heard just about every animal in the local ecosystem and still hunt alligators yearly. After hearing these noises my immediate thought was...\\\"what are people doing out here\\\", when my daughter asked what was that dad? If you've ever heard a panther cry in the wild, than that was the closest animal sound I could explain to my daughter that we might have heard. Immediately after telling her that I heard her take a quick deep breath and quickly looked in the direction she was when I saw what I cannot describe as any animal I have seen in 25 years. I saw something dark brown, upright and moving very quickly across the row between the trees. My daughter asks \\\" dad, what was that\\\" when I replied \\\"I don't know\\\". I kill 10 to 13ft alligators for sport and am not easily frightened. This animal made the hair on my arms stand on end and chills run down my body. After studdering in my nervousness, we finally got the four wheeler started and sped off to our house. On the ride home, after i had in my own mind dismissed all other possible animals, told my daughter that I believe what we saw was a Sasquatch. The next day after work my dad, daughter and I went back to the location to look for hair, footprints or any other signs of the animal with no results. The sand was too soft to even make out the pig tracks. I did however stand with my daughter and have my dad walk to where we saw this animal and do a size comparison. We estimated it to be between 7 to 7 1/2 feet tall and 2 feet wide. Pigs and other 4 legged animals are low and long so I know for sure that's not what this was. So after hearing these sounds and seeing what we saw, the only animal that I can compare to it was a Sasquatch.\", \"location_details\": null, \"county\": \"Polk County\", \"state\": \"Florida\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": \"Report 41265: Possible sighitng at dusk by father and daughter riding an ATV near Bartow\", \"latitude\": 27.93531, \"longitude\": -81.87347, \"date\": \"2013-05-16\", \"number\": 41265.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dhvybvmwcz\", \"temperature_high\": 86.57, \"temperature_mid\": 74.57499999999999, \"temperature_low\": 62.58, \"dew_point\": 60.24, \"humidity\": 0.64, \"cloud_cover\": 0.06, \"moon_phase\": 0.21, \"precip_intensity\": 0.0, \"precip_probability\": 0.0, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": 1019.33, \"summary\": \"Partly cloudy in the afternoon.\", \"uv_index\": 9.0, \"visibility\": 9.95, \"wind_bearing\": 127.0, \"wind_speed\": 2.32, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.87347 27.935309999999998)\"}, {\"observed\": \"While driving home one evening approx. 2100, while passing near Tiger Creek, I witnessed something standing on the side of the road.

We were driving along a road that we have been many times. It's a nice little stretch of road with a great view. The land is beautiful with lots of natural Florida woods with swamp areas. There are also many orange groves in this area. It's not uncommon to see turkeys, hogs and occasional deer. The pasture land has cows on it from time to time. When this sighting happened there were no cows around. It was about 12:15 pm. The weather was over cast and it was going to rain at any minute. No other cars around. We passed one after the sighting down the road when we turned around to go back. We have had a ton of rain in this area lately. As we were traveling down the road we came up on this swampy area in a very large oak hammock. My 17 yr old son was the first to ask if me and my mother saw that? My 72 year old mother said yes but what was it? I said I saw it too...we keep driving for about 2 minutes we said nothing then my mother said turn around and go back. We all saw something and we need to go back and look. So I turned around and went back. But it was not there as far as we could see. We pulled up to the area and just sat there. All of us trying to figure out what we saw. We all saw a human like figure standing out in the middle of the marshy swampy area up to it's waist in water. The figured appeared to be a dull brown color. It was wide across the shoulders with hair and looked like moss hanging from it. It was standing up with it's long limbs away from it's body. The head was kinda down. The shape of the head was different. My oldest son described the head as different from a human. We are not sure what exactly it was doing. In the past we have seen cows out in this marshy swampy area. My Mother was trying to justify what she saw hating to admit that it was beyond strange. But she did admit at how very strange it was. I turned the truck around and we headed home. We talked about it a little more and then just let it die. We had a very stressful morning after coming from an appointment to see if my son had cancer.

Myers to visit my grandparents (as we did every December). We stopped in Ocala National Forest \\u2014 I don't remember the campground because we didn't get there until after nightfall, and I remember we went to Alexander Springs the next day, which was close by. Anyway, we drove through the campground and picked one of the last spots, several empty camp spaces away from the closest camper. The night was mild (certainly compared to North Georgia), and we all had sleeping bags, so we just pitched them on the sandy ground under the stars. My mom and my brother and sister were together near the road, but I wanted some space, so I was about ten to fifteen feet away closer to the end of the space. I wasn't afraid of the outdoors; I had already been whitewater canoeing, spelunking, camping, hiking, etc. I loved to hike, and catching snakes was a particular interest. Anyway, I loved being in the woods, and I knew that even bears are scared of humans, and didn't think anything would bother us in a camp site, even if we were on the fringe, for there were a dozen or so other campers around, particularly a small group about four or five campsites away who were having a bit of a party. Anyway, it was late, probably around 10 PM, and so we got in our sleeping bags and went to sleep. I dozed off for...I don't know, maybe an hour...and suddenly woke up. It was pitch black and very quiet, except for the footsteps. At first, I thought it was some big man walking through the saw palmetto; it was definitely bipedal, which is what threw me later. I figured someone was either drunk, looking for a place to pee, or lost. I remember cocking an eye to the trees and could see no light reflected from a flashlight. I remember thinking it odd how someone could navigate the woods in total darkness without a flashlight (which is why I figured it was someone drunk out to relieve himself). After about fifteen or twenty seconds (perhaps a dozen footsteps, crunch\\u2026crunch\\u2026crunch).  I realized it was coming into our campsite; I say IT because I could now hear it breathing, and whatever it was, I realized it was not human. It sounded like something huge, like a Santa Gertrudis bull. I lay very still, listening. Suddenly I heard it very close to my head, no more than a feet away, and it sniffed deeply several times as if it was checking me out. I was suddenly seized with terror, and I have never been afraid like that before. It was an odd reaction; the back of my mind was telling me that it was probably just a bear (the only thing I could think of that would be that big) and that it was simply looking for a pic-a-nic basket. I was wide awake, and I never have had those \\\"night terror\\\" dreams; I was fully conscious. I simply did not want to move. I must have flinched, because whatever it was suddenly went silent. Although I could not hear it, I was certain that it was still there, watching me. After what seemed an extremely long time (it was only about ten or fifteen minutes), the regular noises of the woods stated to come back, and I could hear small animals rustling about the dried palmetto leaves around the camp. I quickly got up and went over to wake up my mom, and I told her that there was a bear in the camp. She grabbed a flashlight, but all we could see was a short way into the woods around the camp. She laughed at me for being scared of nothing. Well, I went to the car, locked the doors, and lay down in the back seat. I had a hard time going back to sleep. At first light we packed up and headed off to Alexander Springs, and that entire trip my mother teased by about how I was so frightened by an armadillo (yeah, an 800 pound armadillo.) I didn't think to check for prints (I did run and quickly snatch my sleeping bag where I had left it), and I neither saw anything nor smelled anything. But I convinced myself that it was a bear, for whatever it was had enormous lung capacity, but it always bothered me that it was obviously walking on two feet, and it left without making a sound.\", \"location_details\": \"Can't remember; I wasn't driving, and it was at night when we got to the campground.\", \"county\": \"Lake County\", \"state\": \"Florida\", \"season\": \"Winter\", \"title\": \"Report 27778: Possible late night campsite intrusion in the Ocala National Forest\", \"latitude\": 29.22079, \"longitude\": -81.80539, \"date\": \"1974-12-20\", \"number\": 27778.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"djjy4rrpkq\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-81.80539 29.22079)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have been interested in this for years because in my family it was taken as fact for most of my life.

My grandmother (now deceased), my mother, my younger sister and supposedly me (though for some reason I swear I don't remember it at all) were at a place where people dumped trash. We had thrown some stuff away and were looking at some things that others had tossed. My mother is 80 and still remembers this vividly and so does my sister. My sister says it was a Bigfoot! My Mom tells the story that it was a \\\"big ole hairy hippie!\\\" More like a man than an ape. When she was alive my grandma had a similar story.

He was hairy all over with tangled reddish brown hair. This happened in full daylight with the creature approaching us from the wood line in an aggressive manner (grunting and making sounds) at a fairly close distance. Everyone retreated to my Grandma's old Chevy and by the time we got moving we were face to face at smelling distance.

Approximately 4:30 pm as the light was fading, I heard two loud, distinct \\\"cries\\\" or \\\"yells\\\" that I have never heard before or since.  I could tell the general direction and distance was approximately 150 -200 yds in front of me.  As I sat there looking, the wind was blowing at my back so I did not notice any unusual smell, but anything downwind from me may have smelled me.  About 10 minutes later I heard the \\\"yell\\\" again.  Possibly a bit closer ~ 125 yds.  I remember a large Oak tree about 50 - 75 yds in front of me.  There was a small sapling (8 - 10 ft tall) next to the large tree, with surrounding grasses about 2-3 ft tall.  About 10 min after the last yell I noticed the sapling being whipped back and forth.  I took special notice due to being on \\\"alert\\\" from the noise - and further the sapling was violently shaking side to side - not in a constant direction.  Almost like something grabbed the tree near the base and started to  push / pull creating a whipping effect near the top.  I looked at the tall grasses surrounding the area and they were not blowing in the same manner.  This tree appeared to be moved by something. I thought at first it may have been a squirrel that jumped on the sapling - but it shook for about 30-60 seconds - then stopped, then again for another 30 seconds.

So, we drove further thru the woods and had to cross a pretty deep creek to get to the other side, where the road continued, if you want to call it a road.

My girlfriend fell asleep right away and I layed there for about a half hour with a headache and coudn't go to sleep. I was listening to what sounded for sure like raccoons chattering around our site, figured they may be looking for crumbs. Suddenly the noise of raccoons stopped and everything was silent. I thought it was strange such a sudden silence and I smelled what semed to be the sent of a skunk. I thought that was strange because i had been living in Florida 20 years and never smelled a skunk. I thought there were no skunks in Florida. I sat up thinking i would go outside the tent and see what was going on, when i looked to my right i saw a shadow cast on the tent from the lighting in the campground, what looked to be like a man and my first thought was,\\\"surely no other campers would take our food in the night.\\\" It made a noise that i questioned was a bear but didn't sound like any bear noise I had ever heard and I'm originally from upper Michigan near the Great Lakes very remote area with alot of bears and had seen and heard many in my life. Then i got to thinking this figure was standing up and not on all fours and was so tall I thought it couldn't have been a man stealing our food. There were not many campers on the grounds that night either. At first I was approaching the door of the tent to go out and investigate when i heard the strange noise again. It sounded like a grunt noise. I did not feel this was a bear but couldn't imagine what it was, I was somewhat frozen in fear for a minute. Then I started talking to my girlfriend  trying to wake her up and she was scared. We only had one small flashlight and no weapons as we sat there stating we wish we had a gun,  so i did not go outside of the tent, but could not go to sleep that night. The next morning at early daylight we came out of the tent to find a mess. Our coolers had been ransacked, most food gone. I attributed this to the raccoons but realized they were not there long enough to make such a mess i didn't think. So we just laughed about it most of the day and joked about Bigfoot but never did we actually think that was what may have been outside of our tent and eating our food, We had to go in to town for more groceries that day. Late that night things felt strange and it had been lightly raining all day, to a heavier rain by nightime. we sat in the tent playing cards talking about this thing i saw outside the tent. We decided to get out quick, packed our stuff up and even left the tent. At work a couple days later i asked a friend at work who had been there the week before camping if she had ever seen any bear there and she said yes. But when i told her what i saw she said it sounded too weird. It took a few days before i unpacked the car and then realized we had left behind the tent. I called the Ranger at Alexander Springs and told them we had left our tent. They stated they wondered what had happened to us. We told them to keep the tent or dispose of it. They said they could store it for us till we came back again. We told them we didn't think we would be back anytime soon to go ahead and do what ever they wanted to with it.  We did not tell them of our experience and I never told anyone because i thought they would think I was crazy. When I came across this site i was hesitant to report it but my girlfriend has encouraged me too. I know that what i saw was not a bear and way to tall to be a man or even a tall man.\", \"location_details\": \"West on st road 40, just past Astor, turn off to the left on 19, it is in the East side of the Ocala Nat.

Later in the evening, we heard a very strange, gurgling sound that sounded like nothing I have ever heard before.

The next day which was saturday was when a friend and I decided to check out a location where sightings had previously occurred. We all visited this location before and saw or heard nothing. On this day we drove up to the sight because my friend had not been there. As soon as we got out of our vehicle we heard a loud whack! We both looked at each other and nodded our heads. About 20 seconds later we started to hear rythmic knocks. My friend was quite shocked at what he was hearing. That was when we decided to get out the baseball bat. I told Matt that whatever we heard responded back the same way we did. As this went on I decided to go out and investigate. That was what we were there for so I walked around the area. I saw no tracks or anything around the sandy areas so I decided to go beyond this area into the woods. Matt and I kept radio contact the whole time. Another member of our trip was also monitoring our conversation from a couple of miles away. Once I got into the woods there was alot of fallen leaves on the ground and every time I took a step I made alot of noise. The freaky part is that when I would stop I could distinctly hear something moving about 60 yards in front of me. It sounded bipedal and it's steps were louder than mine. Meanwhile back at the truck, Matt was still hearing knocks. I kept making excuses fot what it could be. There was a slight breeze blowing through so I figured maybe the trees close together were maybe bumping. That excuse went out the window when the knocks turned rythmic. Also the walker I heard made me assume that maybe possibly I was walking onto someones property. My other friend who was listening to our talk stated that the whole area was nothing but woods and eventually I would run into a lake. He knew this because his cabin was only a mile or so away. The walking continued fot about 8 to 10 minutes. After it stopped I decided to book. I thought it unwise for me to wander further into the woods alone. As soon as I got back Matt stated that the knocks had also stopped. The remainder of the trip went pretty dry.

I will leave that conclusion to those with more knowledge of Sasquatch behavior to decide. At the time my knowledge of Sasquatch, Bigfoot or the skunk-ape was limited only to what I had seen on t.v. or read in the papers rarely. In fact, I was under the belief that the Patterson tape had been debunked and bigfoot was probably a myth. It was a clear March day and I being off from work decided to take a day hike in Rock Springs State Park. The park is not heavily used I think mainly because its reputation for a healthy black bear population keeps city dwelling day hikers well clear of it. I have hiked many time in bear country and the idea of a bear encounter wasn't a worry. I decided on a loop trail approximately 2 miles in length basically as a warm up then planned on hiking different parts of the area. The woods very basically slash pine and palmetto with clear scrub meadow and shallow swamp areas a little deeper in. A well defined trail led through the palmetto. About 1/2 a mile in I noticed the woods had become very quiet and I began to feel as if I was not alone but being watched. In the middle of the trail I came upon a very large of very fresh scat. It was directly centered in the middle of the trail and the stools were incredibly large and long approximately 3 having lengths of between 9 and 11 inches. This was not bear scat as I have seen piles of that before and never saw continuous lengths of stool such as this. Again feeling that I was not alone I developed the strangest feeling that this was there for me to find and that it was meant as a warning not to go further. The fear I felt became almost irrational but I had no doubt I should turn around and leave this area. I have spent many hours in the woods but had never felt this type of flight or fight feeling. I now know that primates have used scat to mark territory and warn others away. Could this have been a warning left by a primate to me? I honestly don't know.\", \"location_details\": \"SR 46 west.

I was called away to work and was unable to continue with the call. With that said, I would like to finish sharing my experience. I was working as a fence contractor in central FL during the 80s. We had obtained a job to build 10 feed plots for deer in a remote area off of hwy. 44 near the Blackwater Creek area of the Wekiva River Basin. The acreage is vast and was utilized for big game hunting. Since there was a deadline, we had all of the fence material trucked in and we set up camp at the end of the access road. This allowed us to be onsite until all work was complete. On the second day of our stay, we (myself and a helper) were surveying and clearing a fence line in the early morning hours, it was still misty with little light coming through the trees. There was four of us total working, so we split up into two teams to knock out the 10 plots. While my helper and I were clearing brush we were commenting and joking about an odd odor (skunky/sulfer like) we had been smelling a few minutes before reaching the site of the first plot. As we were pulling a string line, abruptly, a dark, bipedal form stepped into our fence line about 60 yards ahead of us. At first we thought it was one of the installers working with us, but as it moved closer to the clearing you could clearly see it was not a human. It appeared to be mostly covered with orange/brown hair, un-human long arms and an odd shaped head (wide, pointy and large) with a very short neck. Once it stepped out, it seen us as well, and when we shouted out the names of the other workers it quickly vanished into the treeline. We viewed the creature for what seemed to be 60 seconds or so before it bolted off. My helper and I were stunned at what we had seen. We spent a few minutes trying to rationalize it but there was no doubt we witnessed something extraordinary. I was carrying a side arm so we walked up to the clearing but could not see anything through the trees, however we did hear something moving rapidly away from us for a few seconds. That was the first of two encounters. The second encounter happened on the fourth night of our stay. All four of us were at camp which was set up on the bank of Blackwater Creek, about 15 feet from the waters edge. That area of the creek is approximatly 12 feet in width from bank to bank. We had began to cook dinner and were still carrying on conversations about our sighting of a hairy creature two days prior, with the other installers ribbing us saying we must had been drinking on the job and such. There was a cooler that we had tied to a rope and placed in the creek to keep the contents cool. As we were eating a loud splash from across the creek startled everyone. One of the other installers ran down to the creek and found that our cooler was gone, as well as the rope and stick it was tied to. We all walked down to the creek bank but there was no sounds other than the normal water movement. The missing cooler was chalked up to raccoons or an alligator. As we settled back into eating, one of the guys walked away to relieve himself, as he returned to the truck everyone looked at him, he was silent and all the color was gone from his face, he just looked at me and said \\\"I'm sorry, I will never doubt anything you tell me again, ever\\\". Not sure what he meant at the time, I asked him what happened, he quietly turned and pointed, saying \\\"someone or something was standing on the other side of the creek watching me pee\\\". It was obvious he was actually scared speechless. I grabbed a spotlight and we all walked down to the spot where he was standing. As I was hitting the treeline with the light there was no sight of any movements, eyeshine or anything so I stepped as close to the waters edge as I could. As soon as I turned the light back on and the beam hit the other side of the creek, we heard a loud grunt, almost similar to a pig, I panned to our left and that's when it all happened. A large bipedal, hair covered animal stood up from behind a group of palmetto bushes. It stood fully erect, the light shine of the eyes were almost gold, it reacted to the light hitting its eyes like a person would, by throwing it's forearm up in front of its face, let out a chilling sound (not a grunt, more like a short howl) unlike anything any of us had heard, it then turned and fled, vanishing like before. All of that happened in just seconds and all four of us witnessed it. We immediately packed up our gear, went to a motel and stayed at the motel until the job was finished. Three of us later went to the FL fish and wildlife office and reported what we had seen. It was during that report when I first heard the term \\\"skunk ape\\\" or even that there had been other sightings of this type. I can honestly tell you, without any doubt, it was not mistaken identity. I grew up as a hunter and outdoorsman and I know what bears look like and also how they act in the wild, it was not a bear, it was definately a primate of some type.

The structure appeared to be about 8 1/2 feet tall at the point where the trees and branches connected. What surprised me the most was the fact that it was not constructed entirely of broken branches, but mostly out of trees that were broken down and still rooted. The entire structure was composed of 6 broken trees and 3 broken branches (this is not including the \\\"base\\\" tree). One of the details of the structure that really stood out to me was the single tree that was bent down, twisted between two trees that were still standing, and then added into the main structure. If this is some sort of Sasquatch-made landmark put there for whatever reason, I don't know for sure, but I do know that it wouldn't have made much of a shelter. That wouldn't make much sense to me if it was considering it's location and lack of practicality as a shelter.

I had stepped out on the back porch to get a soda from the refrigerator. I felt the hair on my neck stand up and about that time, I heard the same low growling noise straight in front of me that we had heard in July. Then, I heard rustling and what sounded like someone running into or hitting the side of our wooden shed out back very loudly. I yelled to my husband and ran out behind the shed with a spotlight. I saw nothing, and there was no noise of something running away. The woods are thick there so, someone or something would only have to stand a few feet away to disappear.

The Pier 44 Marina will be on the left and is visible from the drawbridge. Immediately after crossing the drawbridge from Volusia into Lake County, turn right onto County Road 42 and continue west for about four miles. If approaching on the westbound side of the road, the Lake Mack community will be located on the south (left) side of CR 42, and the Ocala National Forest on the north (right). CR 42 traverses the southern edge of the 600 square mile Ocala National Forest. Having never been to Lake Mack prior to the 15th, I had earlier looked at the Google Maps application installed on my Blackberry to get directions. I noticed that the Ocala National Forest was just across the road, and saw that there were several forest service roads that crisscrossed the southern portion of the forest. I decided that after my visit, I would go drive through the forest and possibly do some exploring and hiking. I finished up in Lake Mack about noon and drove west on CR 42 for about 1 mile, and turned right onto Deerhaven Road and proceeded north into the forest. Deerhaven Road is paved for about the first 2 or 3 miles until it turns into National Forest Service Road 420, which to my surprise was a one-lane, very bumpy, unpaved road. Initially, I was very nervous about continuing, but the dirt-road was compacted and my car appeared to handle it with no problems. Feeling a bit more comfortable, I continued deeper into the woods. I drove for what I would estimate to be another 3 miles or so. The road passed through an area that appeared to have been burned in the past by a forest fire, as most of the pines were dead and only a very thick 3 to 5 ft layer of saw palmetto and other scrubby bushes covered the ground. In this area, the visibility was better due to the lack of a forest canopy and I could see the forest line about a mile in the distance. At this point, the road was still good, and so I continued driving until I the road left the burned zone and entered the tree line into a heavily forested area. I would estimate that after about \\u00bd to 1 mile into the forested area, I started to notice an increasing amount of soft sand in the road rather than the hardened more compacted dirt that I had been driving on previously. I got nervous and decided to turn around and go back out of the forest on NFS 420 the same way that I had entered. At that moment I felt the car sink into sand. I quickly steered left up on the side of the road so that I could get turned around. I was able to get the car turned around in the opposite direction, but when I moved forward about a foot, the car sank deep in the sand. I tried for some period of time to get unstuck, but ended up only digging the tires deeper into the sand. It dawned on me what a stupid idea it was to bring a car into the backcountry\\u2014lesson learned. So here I was, in one of the wildest and most remote areas in the State of Florida completely stranded and all alone. I decided to try to dig out the wheels. I was down on my knees next to the front driver\\u2019s side tire digging the sand with my hands. After a few minutes of this, I stood upright to stretch my back out of the hunched position I had been in. When I stood up, a rock pelted me and a shooting pain went through the inside of my left thigh near the groin area, which caused me to jump back and yelp in pain. Because I was leaning forward against the fender of the car, the rock bounced off my leg and onto the hood of the car, and then slid slowly down the hood and into the sand, which, to my relief, told me that it was not a bullet or snakebite. I immediately looked toward the forest on the other side of the road from where the rock came, and perceived movement in the bushes. At this point, I did not see the creature, but did see movement in the branches and leaves of the shrubs, grasses and saw palmetto. The movement was enough to convince me that someone or something was there, and that it\\u2014whatever it was\\u2014was the source of the rock. Unsure of what to do, I stood there for about 30 seconds and checked my surroundings, including the road to the east and west, and the forest that was immediately behind me. After I turned back from looking into the trees behind me, I heard movement in the forest behind me. The sound that I heard was the sound of leaves and sticks being crushed on the ground, as if someone took one step and then stopped. The sound appeared to come from about 15 feet in the woods behind me. So now at this point, I had perceived movement in the woods on both sides of the road immediately in front of and behind me. I looked back again into the trees behind me where the noise originated, but saw nothing. At this point, the fear struck me pretty hard. Several things crossed my mind, such as wild hogs, bears and coyotes. But none of those animals obviously, to my knowledge, were capable of throwing rocks. Then the thought crossed my mind that perhaps there were a couple of people who had decided to have a little fun at my expense.  So, I called out into the forest, \\u201cWho\\u2019s there? This isn\\u2019t funny. I need help getting my car out of the sand. Please help me,\\u201d and so on. I heard nothing in reply and saw no movement. With the fear mounting and my thoughts turning more toward protection rather than getting my car unstuck, I remembered that I had a can of UDAP in my backpack in the trunk. The previous summer, I had hiked part of the Appalachian Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina and had purchased a couple of cans of UDAP for that trip. I walked around the back of the car, opened the trunk and pulled out my backpack. When I slammed the trunk shut, I again heard movement in the trees on the south side of the road and the location from which the rock had been thrown. I looked to my right and began unzipping the backpack when the creature started to make a hissing sound, though up to this point I still had not visually identified the animal. It was a very loud hissing sound, similar to what you might hear from a feral cat that is being cornered, only much, much louder and deeper. It then started to alternate between a hiss and a vocalization that sounded like \\u201chaaaaawwwww\\u201d. So the sound it was making was a protracted \\u201chhhiiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwww, hhhiiiiissssssssssssssss, haaaaawwwwwwww,\\u201d with an intermittent deeper gurgling sound interspersed throughout. Hearing this put me into flight mode, and I immediately got in the car and locked the doors. When I slammed the door, I looked across the passenger seat out through the passenger side window and saw the creature about 15 feet into the woods as it got up and stood up on two legs. It was out of view previously, as I was able to later conclude, because it had been in a completely prostate position in or behind about 3 or 4 feet of saw palmetto. I saw its head rise up first, then its back, then it appeared to go to all fours, and finally pushed itself up with its long arms onto two legs. I briefly saw its side profile as it did not turn and face me directly, but rather stood up facing east in parallel to the road. Once it rose up completely on two legs, its head was obscured by the tree branches above, while at the same time, its feet and legs were obscured by the saw palmetto and other bushes below. So, at this point, I was looking at its torso through about a 3 to 4 foot clearing between the scrub below and the branches above. To say the least, I was completely petrified. I was locked in my car, but absolutely did not feel safe at all. I would estimate that the creature was about 8 feet tall. It was extremely bulky across the bust, with very muscular arms, and I have no doubt that it could have easily busted out the windows and ripped me to shreds if it so desired. It stood there for what I would estimate to be about 3 seconds. I also observed what would commonly be described as a \\u201clove-handle\\u201d, around the side of the belly area and back. The creature\\u2019s hair was black and gray in color and was slicked down against the lighter skin, which could be seen in some places through what appeared to be wet hair. The hair was very thick on the arms and shoulders but less so around the side belly and back areas. It appeared to be wet because the hair was slicked down against the skin. After standing there for approximately three seconds, it hunched forward and walked east in parallel to the road and was immediately out of sight in the trees. Just before the first step, when the creature hunched forward, it put its hands forward to grab onto some branches, which allowed me to get a glimpse of its right hand. From what I could see, the top of the hand and arm was very hairy. It had about 3 inches of hair hanging down from the wrist area that was longer than the rest of the hair on its arm. One thing that stood out to me: when the arm swung up, I noticed the palm area was much lighter than the rest of the arm, almost a light grey or even off-white color, which was in stark contrast to the much darker hair that covered the other areas of the arm, torso and back. As it swam through the bushes, I could see the trees move and shake as it moved forward through the woods along the side of the road. It walked through the scrub for what I would estimate to be about 15 or 20 feet, and then stopped, again completely obscured from my view. Also, the hissing and other vocalization had stopped at this point and everything was completely quiet. After about a minute had passed of no further movement, I saw a tiny dark portion of the creature peek out from behind a pine tree that was growing near the side of the road about 15 or 20 feet in front of me. I could not perceive any detail at this point whatsoever, just that it was hiding and peaking from behind the tree. It appeared to be crouching down because the peek appeared about 3 or maybe 4 feet up the side of the pine tree from the base of the tree on the ground. It was obvious to me that the creature had previously responded to the slamming of the car door and trunk. Not knowing what else to do, I laid down on the horn and started opening and slamming shut the driver\\u2019s side door hoping that such nuisance noises would drive it out of the area. It did in fact evoke a response, but not the one I was hoping for. After about 15 seconds of door-slamming and horn-honking, the creature lumbered slowly on all fours in sort of a crouched position from behind the tree onto the side of the road right along the tree line. I quickly slammed the door shut. As soon as the door slammed, the creature reared back and flung a soft-ball sized amount of slimy brown, lumpy material that was about the consistency and color of \\u201cwet\\u201d peanut butter all over the hood of the car. It slid down the hood and onto the sand in front of the car, leaving a wet residue on the hood. It then put its arms forward, moving out of the crouched position, and then quickly crossed the road in front of me using both its arms and legs to walk on all fours, just like a four-legged animal. It looked back at me briefly and then disappeared into the tree line on the opposite side of the road. One thing I noticed at this point is that the creature was completely soaking wet from head to toe. When it flung the material at the car, I saw water drops shake off of the arm. It was very wet with the hair laying slicked to the skin, much like what you might see with a wet, long-haired dog. The face of the creature was a dark grey color, with very large dark eyes. It had a very large mouth with extremely large, fat lips. The nose was human-like, with one exception, which was large, slightly flared nostrils. The nose did not protrude off its face in proportion to a human\\u2019s, but was flatter and more sunken. The creature looked like an ape, but with facial features\\u2014especially the nasal area\\u2014that were very similar to those of humans. I resumed honking the horn, but did not open the door because I did not have eye contact with it and further knew that it was now in the forest on the same side of the road where I was sitting in the driver\\u2019s seat. I did not want to give it the advantage of an open door should it decide to jump out of the woods to my immediate left and attack the car. About 1 minute after disappearing into the tree line, the creature reemerged, this time walking completely upright on two legs, just like a human. It paused at the tree line for a second, and then took one huge step back across the road. The creature, to my shock and horror, was carrying along a \\u201cchild\\u201d of the same creature. It had both arms of the smaller creature grasped in its right hand, and was dangling the juvenile along by its side, with the legs of the smaller creature almost touching the ground. The smaller creature appeared to be completely limp from the neck down, but its eyes were open and it was moving its head and looking toward the trees to which it was being carried. After crossing the road, the creature paused at the tree line on the opposite side of the road, lifted the juvenile up onto its hip, and continued into the scrub. Just before disappearing, the small creature wrapped its legs around the back and stomach and clung to the creature\\u2019s chest with its arms. Basically, it was carrying the smaller creature in the same way that a human would carry a child on the hip. It did not reemerge from that point forward, nor did I see any sign or hint of it again. I would estimate that the smaller creature was about three feet tall. It was also a different color than the adult, with the child being more of a light brown, with possibly some hints of a red and blonde, versus the black and grey color of the adult. One thing that stood out about the child is that it appeared to be very, very thin, almost to the point of appearing emaciated. I could actually see the outline of the ribs through the skin and hair that covered it. I sat petrified in my car for about an hour until I looked up and saw two hunters driving Jeeps down the road toward me. They were kind enough to pull my car out of the sand, and quickly got me going on my way out of the forest. Once I got on HWY 44, I left the area at about 85 mph and never looked back. I was in a state of complete shock over what I had experienced. Prior to this experience, I was not a Bigfoot believer.

It was between 4 and 4:30 pm while I was driving that I noticed something running on someone's farm land. There were cows gathered in a pasture near the house. The creature was running in their direction but at a long even stride. I was probably about 150 yds away on the highway. It was brown/black in color and was the same all over. The stride was long, maybe about 3 1/2 to 4 ft. between steps. The creature looked at least 6' ft tall.

As we approach one of the more deserted areas along the road, I spotted something off to the right hand side of the road. At this point it was not clear as to what it was. I slowed down a bit thinking it may be a dog or animal. I've commonly seen many nocturnal animals along this stretch of road in the past. As we approached somewhat closer, it stepped out into the path of the car. We, at this time, were moving approximately 20 MPH as the animal came in to direct headlight.

Once again she said \\\"Dad, what was that?\\\" I sat there with my mouth hanging open, then tried to think of what to say that wouldn\\u2019t spook her. We had just passed a cow pasture about 30 feet prior, so I babbled, \\\"I a...a...a think it was a cow.\\\" We drove silently for a few miles. The whole time I'm thinking to myself, \\\"You just saw a Skunk Ape\\\". She then turned to me and said, \\\" Dad, cows don't walk on two legs... Looked more like a Bigfoot to me.\\\" I stuck with my ridiculous \\\"cow story\\\" until she was much older. She's now 18 years old, and we've laughed about the cow story for years. These days we both use each other as our witness that on that April in 1994 we both did truly indeed see a Bigfoot. My youngest daughter was asleep in the back seat during the entire event.

Approximately forty or fifty yards away, I noticed a loomering figure. It was tall, black, and had thick fur that appeared to be semi-long and coarse. It wasn't facing us and due to the height of the bushes and palmettos, a lower half the body wasn't visible to our eyes. My guess at it's height is somewhere between six and seven feet tall at the top of its head. The creature was moving away from us and though I don't recollect any noise ( I'm assuming I was far too frightening to remember it, because only seconds after seeing it, we ran ), but my best friend, who was standing directly at my side, claims she heard it moving through the foliage and creating quite a bit of sound such as breaking twigs, branches, and leaves rustling.

Back to my story, after we heard the noise I motioned to my friend to be silent so I could trolling motor over to the bank so I could try to get a look.  As we were silently getting closer it seemed like the creature must have noticed us because we stuck out like a sore thumb against the back drop of the creek, while it stayed perfectly camoflauged in the wood.  We sat there for a few moments hoping it would move and reveal itself to us which it never did. So, as the sun was dropping we had to get back to the boat ramp, we quitely circled away from the shore.  Just as we got away from the tree line something landed in the water about 50 or so feet from the boat. It was a loud splash like a rock or heavy object was thrown because it hit about 15 feet from shore.  Both startled we put out life jackets on and got ready to leave when we heard the footstep start back up, and they sounded as if they were running away at a brisk pace and it sounded like it was a long stride. Jokingly we said we had just encountered a sasquatch just like every other time I heard something unusual on that body of water.  But as we made our way back to the dock I noticed we were within half a mile from powerlines.  And were within a mile of the county dump that I know for a fact is a popular spot with the local whitetail deer population.\", \"location_details\": \"250 yards west of the train tressel on the north bank.

On the way up to the roof, some of us noted a foul smell emanating from the basement, As all of the lower windows were broken, we assumed an animal had crawled in there to die. Suddenly, one of the guys at the edge yelled for us to look below him. We all came to the roof edge and observed a tall, hairy creature leaving the basement of the house and walking upright towards the edge of the trees, directly away from us. As soon as the creature reached the tree line, it turned and squated facing us on the roof, about 40 yards away. The creature was about six feet tall, with reddish-brown hair all over it's body. It made no noise or other movement. This silent standoff continued until the creature suddenly stood and gazed far off to the west. It had heard our trucks arriving before we could even see them from the roof. The creature turned and had totally disappeared within just a few steps away from us. Although we were looking down from a height in full daylight, it was just gone. Later, we examined the basement and noticed a sleeping area under the stairs.

I was armed with a Remington model 1100 12ga. shotgun. I was walking between two large Cypress Bayheads in a sawgrass field that was approximately 500 yds. wide by 1/4 mile long. I was looking down at the ground searching for hog tracks. I had seen a group of about 8 hogs approximately 45 minutes earlier, and was trying to outflank them. I looked up to see how close I was to the Bayhead, when I saw, what at first was just a dark object at the edge of the bayhead. My first thought was that it was a bear. I crouched down and started to advance in order to see it better, and, maybe get a shot at it. When I was approximately 80 to 100 yards away, it stood up on two feet. I froze solid, inside and out! What I saw was NO BEAR! It's back was to me at first, but after about five seconds, it turned to face me. It was dark brown to black in color, stood approximately 6 1/2ft. high and was VERY solidly built. I got the height by looking at vegetation where it had stood after the encounter was over. I was able to view the creature for approximately 10 to 15 seconds before it turned and went into the bayhead. I think it took me five to ten minutes just to get my heart rate and breathing back to normal. I forgot all about the shotgun I was carrying! When I approached the area where it had been, I detected a foul odor lingering in the air. It was like something had soured. The grass was bent down, but there was no bare dirt from which to detect a track. I DID NOT follow it into the bayhead! I have told only my wife and father of this incident. I had heard, from time to time, about Bigfoot in the Pacific Northwest, but this was the farthest thing from my mind that day. There is a creature in that swamp that is not a bear, not a human.

My husband went out to investigate because our dog sounded as if were scarred or being hurt. When my husband got to our shed he saw a large shadow up against the siding and it sounded as if our dog were being muffled. He ran back into our home thinking it was a bear or something to the effect and grabbed his gun. He then went back outside ( us trailing close behind him) and it appeared to him as if something were running down our driveway - in the meantime our dog was hidding underneath our home. My husband fired a couple of shots towards the area he thought this creature or animal was and we heard a very loud growl howl type noise, after that it got deathly quiet. I will never forget the chills that ran up me when I heard theses sounds.The next morning we did check the area and we did find weird type footprints that looked not like human nor were they a bear or any other type of animal that I am familar with. Whatever it was it was able to make a leap from the street and across a canal and land on it's feet. The only thing that we can figure is that during the day we had taken our family fishing in the grove and we were followed back by what I honestly believe to be a bigfoot. Our home sat on a hill that when our porch light is on it can be seen from within the surrounding woods - we checked this - I believe it followed the lighting as it knew there was something there. We later found out that the people who occupied our home before us had an encounter with the backdoor being ripped off it's hinges. They assumed it was a burglary while away. We now suspect not. We were told also through my husbands supervisor that several sightings had occured not only in the area but at Lake trafford as well. Lake Trafford was less than 5 miles from where we were living at the time. I will never forget my experience with this night. I thank God my chldren were sleeping but unfortunately my younger brother was not - he was 10 at the time and I remember him being so very frightened and crying. He still remembers that night.

My friends had a camp there, along with other people who had been there for years. This area is a weekend get away spot were people go to hunt and camp. The area is very swampy and filled with many oak and cabbage palm hammocks and cypress heads. To get around the terrain you must have a four wheel drive swamp buggy with good clearance. On this particular day we had drove many hours in search of hog tracks. We used dogs to sniff out the hogs, by driving on the swamp buggy trails. I had noticed a certain trail that had not been used for quit some time and no visible buggy tracks. I came up to a big puddle in the road and notice that the animals in the area had been using it to drink from. I saw hog tracks, deer, turkey, raccons, birds. Noticing the hog tracks I drove completely around the pool of water to save this a as a marker to return later in the evening. Around midnight we drove two buggies into the area that I suspected hogs would be hiding from the midday sun. We drove all night crashing down palmetto bushes that had grown up in this area on the trails.  During this time no other human sign had been observed until the next day. At the pool of water where I saw the animal sign I returned and found some strange tracks. I appeared to be human shaped, bipedal. One was very big and the other very small like a child's or possibly deformed. The tracks had a stride of approximately six feet, with a depth of two to three inches . I tried to imitate the step and stride and could not. I would fall over and barely broke the surface of the mud a half inch. When I stomped my foot into the mud I still could not reach the depth of the suspicious tracks. I went back to the camp and told my friends what I had found. We then returned to the location later that evening and to my amazement new tracks were found. The  maker of the tracks had returned after my departure. It may be noted that myself and friends are veteran law enforcement officers who have seen it, done it and got a T-shirt . We don't believe what we hear and half of what we see. At this point we were very suspicious and concerned about what we had stirred up out of the swamp the night before. We had a 8 mm vhs camera and video taped the tracks and the comparison of our tracks. Three out of five of us believed that we had found the tracks of an escaped gorilla , being that the hurricane had damaged the Miami zoo and reports of escaped monkeys had been reported. Or the tracks of a skunk ape.  Being police officers you don't run back to town and tell everyone that you saw skunk ape tracks while on a vacation. We left the area in amazement and discussed the possibilities of it being a skunk ape. While riding back to camp approximately 3 miles from the suspicious track location on a hard dry road bed we found another set of tracks.  The track impressions were as deep as the ones found near the mud. At this time we were convinced that no human had made these tracks because of the lack of other vehicle tracks and the fact that someone walking 3 miles barefoot in this terrain with one bad foot was unlikely. We video taped this track spot as well. Upon returning home a couple of us were convinced that this needed further investigation.  I spoke with some of the old timers that had hunted this part of the country and they laughed about my tale.   Later in the spring I returned to the area to try to locate the tracks again so that I could take casts and photos if I found anything. The area was like what I had found prior to driving in the swamp months earlier, no tire tracks just the local inhabitants, hogs, deer ,turkey. These woods are thick and I do believe that an intelligent creature could sneak around undetected from civilized man. The land is rich with food and shelter. I have moved away from my home in the Glades and often wonder if I had scared a skunk ape from his hiding spot in that pristine oak hammock during the fall of 1993 or was it a prankster. We never told anyone out side our circle of friends and never read about mysterious tracks found in the Everglades and or spoke with anyone down there that might have seen the same tracks.

On Wednesday 7-16-97 around 2:00 pm, Goodbread was driving a tour bus, with a group of tourist, along  Turner Road.  Goodbread arrived at an area where there is a burned out wooden  bridge across the canal on the east side of the road.  Goodbread and the tourists observed a large brownish colored creature behind some brush near the bridge. The creature continually stood upright on two legs, was approximately 7' tall, had hair covering it's entire body (except for the face) and was rocking back & forth.  Goodbread advised that the creature resembled a gorilla. Goodbread indicated that the creature was shaking the bushes and appeared to be irritated by their presence. The creature was approximately 70 to 80 yards away. Goodbread continued to watch the creature for about 15 minutes.  Goodbread repeatedly eased the tour bus forward and backward so as to allow visibility, of the creature, to everyone on the bus. Goodbread attempted to get one of the tourist, with a telephoto lens on her camera, to exit the bus and take photographs of the creature. No on would get off the bus. Goodbread now feels that exiting the bus might have been a bad idea. Goodbread finally drove away, leaving the creature at this location.  Goodbread later returned to the area and found a road where he could drive into the swamp. Goodbread did not locate the creature again. Goodbread feels that the creature might have been a hoax but states that it would be nearly impossibly for a human to withstand the heat, at that time of day, in a suit. This is also an area that is heavily populated by alligators. Goodbread states that they have been observing a large number of  deer and hogs moving out of the swamp because of the high water. Goodbread feels that he is in a little disbelief of what he saw, although  he believes in the possible existence of the skunk ape, and prefers not to associate the creature with his tours. Dow Roland is a tour guide for Everglades Day Safari. Rowland was driving a tour bus on Friday 7-18-97  around 2:30 pm , with a group of tourist, along Turner Road. Roland observed a brownish colored bipedal creature about 300' west of the  road, at the edge of the brush. Roland described the creature as being  approximately 7' tall, long brown hair, standing upright when walking or  running, having a smooth face and resembling a gorilla.  Rowland's observation, of the creature, was brief before it ran into the brush. Rowland's initial thought was that it was someone in a gorilla suit playing a prank.  Rowland was on his return trip at the time of this sighting.  A few minutes later Rowland returned to the same area, on Turner Road, with another group of tourists. Rowland was near the area where he had first observed the creature. Rowland again observed the creature on the west side of Turner road. This time the creature was approximately 150' from the road and again the observation was brief before the creature ran into the brush. The creature appeared to act  nervous. Rowland believed this to be the same creature that he had previously observed. Rowland indicates that he was still shocked and  in disbelief that this could be a real creature. Rowland finished the tour without observing the creature again.  After completing the tour, Rowland retrieved his camera and returned to the area on Turner Road. Rowland drove up & down Turner Road but was unable to locate the creature. Rowland was driving south near the area of his other sightings, preparing to give up his search, when he observed a white convertible driving north. The convertible passed him and continued north bound.  Rowland looked in his rear view mirror and observed the convertible stop suddenly then drive off. In an instant Rowland observed the creature appear at the west edge of Turner Road, approximately where the convertible had stopped. Rowland turned around but the creature had again disappeared into the brush. Rowland was unable to locate the creature again. The next day, on Saturday 7-19-97, Rowland told David Shealy of  his observations. David Shealy is the owner/operator of the Florida Panther Gift Shop located on Highway U. S. 41 one mile west of Turner Road. Jan Brock is a Collier county realtor who lives in the area of Ochopee,  Florida.  On the morning of Monday 7-21-97 Brock was traveling south on Burns road, sometime just prior to 7:45 am, in route to work.  Brock traveled through this location just prior to Vince Doerr.  Brock was approximately 2 miles north of U. S. 41 when she observed a creature, that she indicated was approximately 1000 feet in front of her car, cross the road.  Brock first observed the creature at the west edge of the road.  The creature crossed the road, heading east, and disappeared into the thick brush and trees on the east side of Burns road.  Brock described the creature as about 7' tall, covered with a furry coat of thick dark brown hair and what appeared to be a patch of off-white or light colored hair on it's chest. Brock explained that she has often times traveled the roads, observed the wildlife, and has seen numerous animals in the Everglades.  Brock compared the light colored chest patch, on the creature, to similar coloration that she has observed on bears that have been laying on the local limestone roads.  Brock further explained that this creature was definitely not a bear, that it's legs were too long to be a bear and that it walked upright the entire time of her observation. Brock recalls that she noticed that the creature looked in her direction but she was too far away to view the physical characteristics of any facial features.  Brock drove to the location, where the creature had crossed, and stopped her car.   Brock rolled her window down part way but did not exit her vehicle.  Brock looked around for the creature and for signs of any footprints.  Brock was unable to observe any further signs of the creature.  Brock commented that she had heard of the pungent odor, reportedly emitted by the Florida skunk ape, but she did not smell anything abnormal.  Brock drove on to work without any other sightings.  Brock's family has owned property, in this area, for many years.  Brock used to bring her children, when they were young & before they built a house there, to the area for picnics and weekend camping trips.  This would have been in the late 1960s.  Brock explained that her children would often claim that they saw a bigfoot creatures around their property and in the swamps.  Brock advised that her family has never been bothered by the creatures.  Brock does believe that the creatures exist and does not fear them. On  7-21-97, Vince Doerr, driving south from his home toward U.S. highway 41 in route to work, observed a Skunk Ape cross the road approximately 600' to 800' in front of him. The creature was moving from east to west at a slow pace. The witness arrived at the crossing sight, exited his vehicle and took a photograph, of the creature, approximately 80 yards away in the swamp. The picture is of the rear and upper torso of the creature. The creature was approximately 7' tall, bulky, reddish dark brown in color and continuously walked upright.  This photo is not entirely clear, the alleged creature is circled in the center of the photo.  In the future the BFRO will be doing enhancements on the photo, we will update the report when the enhancements are complete.   David Shealy learned of fire chief Vince Doerr's sighting, and associated it with what Dow Roland had told him earlier.  On Thursday 7-24-97 Shealy went to the area, on Turner Road, where the creature had been observed. Shealy is a long time resident of the area and is familiar with the swamp. Shealy began searching the area.  He found, what he believed to be, hair on some brush. The brush was along side a path. The hair was brown  in color and approximately three inches in length. The hair was later lost. (The information can be explained by the researcher.) Shealy located several large tracks in the area. Shealy was able to take plaster casts of two of the tracks. The footprints measured  approximately 13.5\\\" in length, approximately 6\\\" in width at the toes and approximately 3\\\" in width at the heel. (The researcher, in this case, has examined and photographed the plaster casts.) A couple (names confidential) was out watching birds and wildlife when it began to get dark. The couple prepared to leave the area and turned on their headlights. They were traveling north on Turner road when they observed a creature cross the road approximately 100 to 200 yards in front of them... They drove to the area of the crossing and turned their vehicle towards the west side of the road, in the direction that the creature had traveled.. As they turned their car, the headlights caught an object about 30 yards from the west side of Turner road. As the couple looked closer, they realized that it was a very dark complexioned man-like creature that they described as being well over 7' tall, 300 to 400 pounds and looking like a linebacker for a football team.... The creature constantly kept it's back to the vehicle and moved out of the headlights... As the couple moved the car, to place the creature back in the headlights, it again moved out of the light... The couple became concerned and left the area... When the couple were asked about further details, of the creature, they advised that they never saw the face and were unable to advise as to body hair.  The couple reported this information to a local wildlife naturalist and tracker... The couple refused to give their names or any contact information, advising that they did not want to be harassed.\", \"location_details\": \": (#1)Ochopee, Florida...

The campsite is on an old shell mound that the indians used to call\\\" Bad Land\\\".The site is only accessed by boat and it takes about an hour to get to the site from the nearest ramp in chokoloskee. The national park butts up to Big Cypress Preserve. The weather was dry & cool. One of the nights five of the guys decided to do some night fishing in the backbays of the everglades,They left the camp and you could hear their motors running for miles back in the bays. They had been gone since about 2- hours when the other person at the camp turned in for the night. I was fishing off the bank relaxing & waiting for the guys to get back.It had been about an hour since the other person turned in.It was around 11:30 at night when I heard the most piercing scream I have ever heard in my life!.....It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up stand up!!! I have heard panthers scream and bobcats and this was a more high pitched sound!I was turning all the lamps on in camp whem about 30 seconds after the first scream, I heard a second. same exact sound. I estimated the sounds to be about 75-100 yards. I thought to myself \\\" this cannot be a person, I would have heard their boat coming from miles away and the island is filled with razor sharp mangroves with oysters & barnicles all along the banks\\\"The only place to get off is the campsite. I did not hear anymore screams that night! About 20-30 minutes later I heard my buddy,s motors coming in the distance.

We had just finished a job and came into the office for a new assignment. Frank told us he had a \\\"special job\\\" and would consider it a favor if we did it. The developer of Boca Teeca had a couple of hunting cottages, in the everglades, and it wouldn't take us more than a couple of days. We would have to camp over since it was too far to drive and there wasn't any lodging around. Now my wife was over 7 months pregnant and I wasn't crazy about doing the job. However, Frank was persausive, \\\"If you want to continue working for me you'll do it!\\\" I didn't have health insurance and was making payments to Bethesda Hospital, in advance, for my wife's upcoming hospital stay. So I caved in and took the job. The next day we packed some camping gear in the station wagon. My idea of camping was a state park or KOA camp. We set off. The directions were simple: take the Florida Turnpike south and go west on Alligator Alley, about halfway across you will see a gravel road to the left. Pass it and take the next gravel road to the left. The work site would be halfway between Alligator Alley and the Tamiami Trail. Looking back I would say this would have put it in Collier County, Florida (the beginning of everglades country). We taveled miles and miles, under the hot sun, on Alligator Alley, for what seemed miles and miles of miles and miles. Coming to the second gravel road we turned left and traveled more miles and miles down a washboard gravel road. I had packed fishing gear and a .22 cal. magnum pistal (with holster) and two .30 cal.M1 carbines. A canal ran parralel to road and I had at least wanted to get my hook wet. I talked him into stopping for 15 mins. or so (to stretch our legs) and I dropped a line in the canal. It was full of alligator gar which were stacked up like cord wood. My father spotted a water moccasin on the other bank and I took my .22 mag, aimed behind the head, shot and took its head clean off. We started up again and after many more miles saw a sign \\\" XXX XXXXX Site.\\\" We arrived in the early afternoon. The two cottages turned out to be two houses. Each identical and 2 stories high. The developers had a drive made by dumping a pad of coarse gravel, about 2.5 to 3 feet high, about 300 yeards back into the swamp. At the end, and right, of each drive was a big square of gravel the houses were built on. This was going to be more than a 2 day job. We started taping the houses. While I was working I could hear something rummaging around out in the bush. I couldn't see anything but there was a strong odor similar to the pig farm next to my grandfather's farm (in Ohio). XXXXX XXXXXX had a reputation as being a boar hunter and I assumed it was a boar. We worked till dark and cleaned and packed up our tools. I had Dad start a camp fire on the part of the drive that went past the house (you had to do a 3 point turn in the car port area to turn around). I set up the cots and put on my holster and .22 mag revolver (just in case we encountered a charging boar). Dad brougt a slab of bacon (his idea of camp food). Oh well, he was doing the cooking. It smelled good too. One thing about Dad, he's  a master chef when it comes to ruff grub. We ate bacon and beans and home fries and then sat around the fire talking. The whole time I kept hearing the rummaging around in the everglades. The sound seemed to be getting nearer. It occurred to me if it were a wild boar, or anthing as larges as the sounds indicated, the .22 mag probably wouldn't be too effective. I decided to go get one of the carbines. As I stood up and started to go to the wagon I turned and saw two eyes staring from about 20 foot away. First thougt... an owl. But then I realized what I was looking at. I froze in my tracks. Next thought a bear. Only I was staring level in its eyes. I was on a gravel pad about 2.5 to 3 foot higher than it was. I am 5 foot 6 inches. My God... it was 8 to 9 foot tall. My hand went for my gun. I drew it and was going to fire. Only I realized if I shot this thing all I was going to do was really piss it off. Also, it wasn't acting threatening. It was just watching. It had a face more human than a bear or ape. Closer to an Australian aborriginal. I could also see its skin. It didn't have thick fur. It had sparse, long and whispy like strands. The hair was more like an orangutan. Only these were things I put together later. At the time I was just plain scared. As a Viet Nam verteran, with a purple heart, I wasn't overscared either. Let just say I had a strong sense of self preservation. I made a bee line for the house and momentarilly thought about stopping to get the carbine from the wagon. However, my feet took me into the house and up the stairwell. My Dad was hot on my heels. I went to the window which faced the camp fire. As I looked out the window I asked Dad, who was across the room, \\\"Did you see that?\\\" He said, \\\"No.\\\" I told him, \\\"then what the heck were you running for?\\\" He said, \\\"I saw you draw your gun, then didn't shoot and then run off. I figured you had a good reason.\\\" I told him, \\\"we need the carbines. You go out and get them and I will cover you.\\\" He wouldn't do it. Still looking out the window I noticed we left the slab of bacon on a log near the camp fire. Then I saw it come out of the brush. I told Dad, \\\"There it is. Come over here and look at it.\\\" He woudln't do it. I don't know if he could have got across the room in time any way. It crossed the viewable area, may 100 ft. in a few strides. As it walked it scooped up the slab of bacon. It didn't really bend over. It just dropped a shoulder slightly. It was walking upright the whole time. I might add it was walking, not running. It was casually strolling as if it didn't have a care in the world. It dawned on me that it didn't mean any harm. It justed wanted the bacon. Anyway I went to the wagon and got the carbines. Even though I wasn't sure what I saw and I concluded it didn't mean any harm I wasn't taking any chances. I told Dad we were going to take two hour watches. He decided to sleep first. I woke him up in two hours and told him to awaken me in two hours. I woke up in the morning and he was fast asleep. Whatever it was could have had us. If it had wanted to. The doors had not been installed yet. I went out and looked for tracks. Nothing on the gravel. I didn't expect any. I climbed down to the ground. I thought it would be soft. It was dry and there was a thick pad of pine needles. There were a few scruffed places but the distance between them looked too far apart to be foot steps. I thought about venturing out and looking for a soft spot but at the time I wasn't trying to prove anything but to myself. If my Dad wasn't such a chicken, and had seen it, then I would have been more resolved to look further. Only now I was beginning to wonder if I had imagined the whole thing. I really didn't make the connection until a few weeks after I came home and there was a newspaper article about Sasquatch sightings in the area I had been in. I just made a mental note to ask if any circus or zoo animals had escaped, in that area, and if so I would call and tell them what I saw. I am not relating this encounter to make you a true believer. At that time I know I saw something and this is a report on what I thought I saw. After 28 years I now question it myself. The more time that passes the sketchier the recollection is. I only offer this record in hopes it might help those who are seriously looking for it. I have one reservation.

A few minutes later looked again and that black thing was gone and i was able to see through the forest. I shook the feeling off then that night is where it began. That night for dinner we cooked chicken legs and turkey meatballs over the fire. My brother left the garbage bag hanging 10 feet away from us and we went to bed. 4am I awoke hearing this strange sound in the far distance sounding 3 miles away. The sound came closer and closer to the point i knew it was heading towards my campsite. I woke up my ex-boyfriend, then my brother in another tent. I said do you hear that sound? they said yes be quiet. The sound was a wailing sound with a heavy breath at the end. I thought it was an alien and my ex thought it was a monster. The sound was horrible, and it got closer and closer to the camp. I heard it go by my tent and head in the direction of my brothers to the side of it, then left and went down a trail path behind our tents. I got up and wanted to look out of the tent window but my ex grabbed me and said are you crazy. The next morning we woke up and talked about it and began to trace the direction where the monster walked. I looked down and found a footprint in the sandy trail it looked like a huge foot both wide and long. Both guys put their foot in the print and it was way bigger than their foot in width and length couldnt be a persons foot. It looked like 4 big toes. This wasn't there the day before. We went up the trail and saw a few more of the prints. When we went home a guy friend of my cousins was interested in this phenomena so i went back with him and showed him where it occured and the footprint but it had slightly been messed up. He took picture but it didn't come out good. I wanted to go back again that year but my ex, brother, and cousin said no way. my cousin said she would have to bring a gun if she ever did go back. This strange happening scared them to death. I did go back with my kids and we were fine, no noises heard that night. I heard on the computer the noises of the skunk ape since the guy told me to listen and i couldn't believe it, it sounded a lot like what we had heard at the campsite.

At approximately 6:00A.M we left from Florida International University traveling west on the Tamiami Trail. The weather that day was relatively clear but as I mentioned we had a hurricane passing close to south Florida a few days earlier so everything was still quite humid and the winds were beginning to calm down at about 15 knots to the west. It was near the area of big cypress about 15 minutes from the worlds smallest post office, where the landscape had plenty of saw grass in shallow water and large trees at a distance of about a mile off the road where I saw a figure that seemed to be watching the road as we drove past. This creature was definitely not a person. I know that it was not a person because we had only seen about 5 cars in the entire length of the trip thus far. Whatever it was, it appeared to be large, at least the size of a person, but it was dark, with a wide body structure, and even from the distance at which I saw it (maybe 300-500 yards) it looked as if it was covered in hair. The creature was standing next to a palmetto, and we passed it quite quickly. about 10 seconds after we passed it It came to my attention that I should probably tell my friend to turn the car around to see if I could get a better look. We stopped, drove back to the site, and It was gone. But as I got down from the car there was a very strange smell in the air that was nothing like I had ever smelled before, almost like a wet dog that had been covered in eggs. My guess was that maybe the creature had crossed the road, heard our car and checked us out, and that it realized that it did not like us so much and simply crouched down and hid. Nobody else in the car saw the creature, I was sitting in the back seat on the passenger side, the front seat passenger was asleep and the driver was simply concentrating on the road. I only saw this thing for a few seconds but it left quite an impression on me. Before this I thought that stories about Bigfoot were interesting but I would dismiss them saying that I would believe it when I would see it. But after seeing how remote this area was and how large the Everglades really are, I am now certain that there is a possibility that there is something out there.Thank you for responding to my report and feel free to give me a call at your convenience, if I do not pick up the phone it is probably because I am in class so leave me a message and I will contact you as soon as I can.

Its been about 3 years now since my friend Dan and I saw it. We were walking along a dirt/road trail along the focka canal system to find a good bass spot, as we were walking I thought I saw large brownish colored legs ahead on the trail. I didnt say anything at first until Dan asked me if I saw that. I was stunned and replied \\\"Yea, Huge brown legs cross in front of us and he replied \\\" I thought it was just my eyes\\\". The sasquatch was in a group of trees next to the canal I guess checking us out. The reason I am saying this is because we heard and saw the branches in front of us russling. We were honestly scared and backed away slowly. Now Dan is a officer in the Navy now working I believe out of Miami. He is a very credible none bs type of person. I myself is a biologist and I am super observent of my surroundings. The only reason why we just saw the legs is because we were looking down in front of us so we didnt step on one of the resident water moccasins. Since then I have been going to the same location to try to see if \\\"its\\\" still there and yes \\\"it\\\" is. I havent seen it since the first time but I found an area off the trail that had almost like I guess beds?!? Basically it was long saw grass bundled up together and it was obvious something large has sat in it. Also near by I found skelatal remains and hair from a bear that seemed to literally have been ripped in half. I have also spent many nights fishing in the location and near it and have heard undeniable 'calls\\\" that seem like it came from some sort of primate. Similar to a very deep howler monkey call.  I have a lot of experience with primates from my studies throughout Latin America. Based on that I KNOW it was a primate call. There was another occurence when I was with my friend Chris on Turner River Rd. off Rt.41 South of Ochopee,Fl. We were crawfish hunting after a evening shower and heard some odd noises in the woods across the canal system. Then we smelt a very odd odor I wouldnt say it smelt like rotten eggs like all the other reports but maybe like methane gas. We moved on about 2 miles down the road and was picking more crawfish out of the swamp and heard the same noises followed by the same smell. This occured for another 30 minutes or so and we felt uncomfortable and left. I believe I read that the BFRO went to Florida in 08 on an investigation and I believe it was off Rt.41? I think there is a few key locations that BFRO should check out, 1. Picayune Strand, just outside of Naples, Fl, http://www.fl-dof.com/state_forests/picayune_strand.html, 2. Turner River and Birdon Rds. just south of Ochopee, Fl off Rt. 41 http://www.staynplay.net/florida-tourism-articles/turner-river-road.htm I live in New Jersey but have a condo in Naples,Fl, if BFRO wants to investigate these areas I believe I can find time to come down and show you the exact spots of the occurences. If you have any further questions please contact me I will be more then happy to answer any questions BFRO may have. Please take this seriously, my stories are not bogus, bs statements.

It was around 9:30 p.m., when we started hearing what sounded like wolf howls. The howling become a bit terrifying when we noticed it was getting closer. We then began howling back at it, when we realized we were caught right in between these things communicating. By this time it was already 11:00 p.m., around this time small pebbles began being hurled at us from a distance. It reached such a freaky level when whatever was in the woods just 30 ft. from us was stomping and grunting at us. For some reason at some point we thought for sure it was a prank and began throwing pieces of wood and rocks, when all of a sudden a horrible silence came over us. With none of us wanting to admit we were freaking out, we suddenly mad dashed for the trailer and hid in my dad's room (end of the trailer, pointing to the woods). Trying to play it off we tried sleeping huddled together like a can of sardines. We were overcome by tears and in a frozen like state. Knocking and grunting was all we heard for about an hour, until we gave our position in the trailer when my friend whispered to me to look out the window. For the final time a deep silence overcame outside. I slightly lifted one of the curtain blinds (not sure what their called, but there a series or levers that lift and tilt depending on how you pull or twist the small stick). When I looked out, not fearing due to the fact there were no lights on in the trailer, I saw nothing but what seemed to be my reflection in the glass, I thought I had confirmed it when I tilted my head and my supposed reflection did the same. When I released the blind and was asked what I saw, I told them it was my reflection. I waited about 4 minutes, in which seemed like a millenium, I opened the blinds, I saw nothing but branches and brush. I remember slowly dropping the blind and crying myself to sleep in a way my friends wouldn't hear me. I can't explain why, but whatever was looking back at me through that window could've easily killed me considering the trailer was on an incline and bricks due to the jacks breaking. I would love to go back, which is crazy on my behalf but its alluring.

We were camping in a primitive campsite at Bear Island, Big Cypress Preserve in Collier County Florida. This campsite is off of ORV trails, meaning only off-road vehicles with permits may enter this area. It was a warm evening after a late afternoon rain shower. We had a camp fire burning, there were five of us at camp that night along with two Jeeps parked away from campsite. After sitting near the campsite I wanted to retrieve my charging cell phone from my Jeep. As i walked away from the camp and into the darkness of the night, I reached my Jeep, as I was opening the door, I had a feeling someone was watching me. I looked to my left and about 15' into the woods I saw a pair of glowing yellow, human shaped eyes staring back at me. I am 6'6\\\" tall, and these eyes were level with me, possibly a few inches upward. I could feel the eyes staring into mine, and I watched them blink, slow and deliberate, just like a human. The overwhelming odor was undeniable it smelled like a combination of skunk and wet dog. Every hair on my body stood up right, I had instant goosebumps from my head to toe, and every instinct told me to flee. Without hesitation I quickly returned to the campfire.....Telling everyone what I had just witnessed, and assuring them I was not joking, I gathered a spotlight and a companion and walked over to check it out, without a sound we crept up, and heard nothing. Shining the light into the woods we did not see any signs of an animal, no deer, no bear, no low branches for an owl to be perched on, just a bare spot in the woods where the eyes were coming from. I have watched shows where people talk of Bigfoot sightings, and I always question them. I say I would have chased that thing through the woods with a camera and a flashlight. but now I understand, when you do see something like this, its a combination of shock, fear, and instinct. I would not write in with this sighting if I didn't feel in my gut, and in my mind what I saw, was not something that SHOULD have been in those woods.I was reassured of my feelings this past weekend when we returned to camp in the same spot. We camped in the same location this past weekend. April 28th-29th 2012. Pink jeep number 7, Bear Island Campground, Big Cypress Preserve. This encounter however was not visual, but audible. We had a campfire, there were five of us sitting there. It was approx 10:15, when I playfully made a loud and long howl (Call) into the woods. However we all were astounded when I almost Instantly got a response. The howl, was not a coyote, it was not an owl, or a bear. And it was not a human playing along. The direction the sound came from, was also the direction I had seen the eyes in the woods previously. It is dense woods with no campsites, or foot access. Forward an hour in the future. Me and my daughter and wife are in our tent. My two friends are already asleep in theirs, staked out next to mine. The back of both of our tents are facing the opposite woods that we had heard the howl from. After being in our tents and laying down with the lights out. We were startled, by the loudest crashing sound coming from the woods behind us. It sounded like something just grabbed a tree, snapped it, and smacked part of it against itself. The sound was followed by a few footsteps, then silence. It was so loud and an unexpected sound it awoke the two friends in the tent next to us with a \\\"what the heck was that? \\\". My daughter was the first to notice the odor that was suddenly lingering. Her and my wife compared it to skunk, i thought it smelled more like wet dog, urine smell. Very similar to the odor I noticed previously with the eye incident. I did scout the area where we heard the noise, but could not see anything. No fallen trees, and no obvious damage from where I could access. It did start to rain in the area early in the am. So when we woke up, it had been raining for sometime.Making it harder to notice anything out of place. Am I 100% positive I saw Skunk Ape? No, but I am 100% positive there is something down here, and it could be just that.

This incident occurred with he and my brother-in-law (b-i-l)in 1984 or 1985 (he is not sure of the year since so much time has passed). He and my b-i-l were deer hunting in the fall on some old growth hardwood/pine forrest near where my f-i-l was raised. They had drove into the area, parked, then separated to go to their respective hunting areas (he up hill about 100 yards from the vehicle and my b-i-l about 100 yards down away fromt the vehicle in a bottom area). As they met back at their vehicle, my b-i-l related that he had come across a deer carcass that was torn apart (limbs appeared \\\"ripped\\\" from the trunk and the trunk torn open). He had never seen anything like it. They hiked back to the area and to the carcass and had to push physically push through some thick growth to the site of the carcass. My f-i-l related that the kill was fresh, no more than 24 hours old at the oldest as there was no decay, had not been scattered by scanvengers, and it was too fresh to have maggots hatching. While looking, he related that he began to have a strong feeling of being watched and began to smell something that was a combination of a wet dog and rotting garbage. As it was getting dark, they headed back to their truck. He said the truck was about 100 yards away and as they walked, he noticed the sound of something walking parallet to themabout 10-15 yards into the undergrowth. As they reached the truck (they had both unloaed their guns earlier), something in the underbush less than 10 yard away he estimated, \\\"screamed\\\" at them. He related that he had heard peacocks, deer, bobcat, etc while growing up and while hunting. and this was like nothing either of them had ever heard. Both of them are avid deer and turkey hunters with primitive weapons and firearms and have spent a great deal of time in the woods. The sound was so strange and unnerving that he said the hair on his arms and neck stood up. They both fumbled with their guns trying to reload and to get in the truck as it was almost full dark by then. They immediately left the area as fast as possible. My b-i-l passed away in 1999 and to my knowledge, I never remember or know of him telling anyone else about this. My f-i-l took me back out to the area on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2007. This was the first time he had been back since the incident occurred. He related that he could close his eyes and still hear that scream and he could feel his hairs standing up. We walked the area but it has been clear cut for timber and is now leased to a hunting club (Inland Paper is the land owner) and a gate has been put up so that you have to walk to the area where the incident occurred. The area is in the nw part of the county very close to the Alabama state line. There is no one living close to this area still, there is running water, a large deer population going by the tracks we saw and scat, as well as good cover provided by timber piles and second growth forest returning. My f-i-l had never told this story to anyone else until he heard me telling some other family members abou going on the GA 2006 expedition.

Bernard puppy who was quite upset. I soon learned why as I could hear my neighbors 2 dogs, a great Dane and a husky by the back of our house crying loudly. I was almost 14 at the time and was quite scared by the commotion as was my puppy. I looked out my window towards the cornfield and swamp behind the house but saw nothing but the dogs staring out towards the swamp, they started to go back out to the darkness in full attack mode. they weren't even barking but like screaming at whatever it was out there. I then heard a large rustling sound in the dried reeds by the fenceline. It sounded as if the dogs had been hit and they ran back to the safety of our back porch light. I ran to Moms room but found her at our back kitchen window staring towards the commotion. When the dogs would silence a little we could hear something walking in the reeds. It sounded very heavy like a cow but made no sound other than the walking noise and extra commotion when I believe it defended itself against the dogs. My neighbors across the street also watched from their front porch as this event continued for about an hour. Myself and my friend looked the area over from the safety of our dirtbikes about 3 days later as we were too scared to go out there after what happened. We saw reeds smashed down most of the length of the fenceline and what looked like a deer lay but it was way overgrown and would have been tough to leave a footprint that would be identifiable to a couple of young kids. Just after our incident, maybe a couple of weeks later I remember seeing on the news about a bigfoot sighting at the Cherry Glen campground not too far from our house. Also sightings in the Adel Iowa area the previous November that also made the news. We do not know what was out there that night but my mother remarked how funny it seemed to happen in between two sighting occurences in the area. The swamp is now mostly developed into a housing area nestled in between Saydel High school and n.e.60th avenue in saylor township. I thought this story which is quite well known among my old school buddies would maybe complement the other stories in central Iowa at that same time. Its not dramatic or filled with terror but it sure shook me up for a couple of weeks after as me and my friend were sure it was bigfoot.

It was on a Tuesday afternoon.  It's stuck with me and has bothered me since then (I'm now 36 y/o).  I've never discussed it with anyone since I never felt comfortable relating the story, but after finding your website, I decided that I'm not the only one who has had an experience they can't explain.  This occured on a January afternoon in 1976.  It was after school (approximately 4:00 p.m.) and the weather was sunny and somewhat mild for an Iowa winter(temps approximately in the upper 20's/low 30's).  I took my sled and headed to the country club after school, which was approximately a mile and a half from my house as the crow flies.  I was alone since all my friends had went sledding over the weekend and no one else wanted to go.  In order to get to the country club by foot there are two sets of railroad tracks seperated by approximately 150-yards that you need to cross.  One is a main line that runs North to South (the Burlington Northern) and the other is a feeder line running from town out to the East/West (a B.N. line as well) main line North of town.  The area in between the tracks is covered with various trees, trails, bushes and weeds.  Since we lived on the East end of town, I'd walk down the feeder line and follow a trail (I'd always thought of it as a small game trail)to the mainline which I'd cross over to the country club.  The country club was built around an old pond which had been used by the old steam engines to add water to their boilers.  The area around the country club is of rolling hills, fairways, greens, trees, bushes, and weeds.  The hill I was going to sled down was to the South of where I came across the mainline (it was also about a 1/4 of a mile south from the clubhouse).  I walked across  the mainline, down the hill, and up the hill I was going to sled on.  As I got to the top of the hill, I noticed footprints (not bootprints) in the snow going across the crest running North to South.  At first I found it funny that someone was running around in the cold and snow without shoes or boots.  The snow depth at that time was approximately 5-inches where it had been undisturbed.  The snow at the top of the hill where I found the tracks was packed (approximately 3-inches in depth) but the tracks went in almost completely to the ground!  I stepped off between the tracks, and it took me three full strides to go from one track to another!  You could see perfectly the outline of the foot, the toes, and the heel.  When I put my boot into the footprint it wouldn't touch the outline of the footprint!  The hill I was on had a gentle slope to the South where it finally turned into trees, bushes, and weeds.  The footsteps ran into the trees.  I remember being curious at first as to why these tracks are here, then I became very uneasy because, even though I was only 11-y/o, this didn't seem normal (a normal man has a much shorter stride).  I then remember thinking I came here to do some sledding, so I'll sled.  I went down the hill once and remember getting very scared at the bottom of the hill.  I didn't want to look over toward the trees to my left (the South), so I decided to call it a day and head back home.  As I was walking between the mainline and the feeder line (I followed the trail), I felt as though I was being watched.  When I got to the feeder line, I picked up my pace (that's tough to do when you've got snowpants on and boots).  It took about 20-minutes to get back home.  I had always played on the feeder line tracks since they were rarely used and had hunted birds with my B.B. gun in the area between the feeder line and the mainline.  I never had that feeling before when I'd been out playing or sledding.  I've never had it since.  On a side note:  Later that spring, late at night, I got up to go get a drink of water (my bedroom was in the Southeast corner of the house at the end of the hall.  My parents had the bedroom at the Northeast corner with two windows, one facing East, one facing North).  As I was coming back from the kitchen, I looked through their bedroom door and saw a figure looking through the East Window.  It was backlit by the streetlight.  My hair stood up on the back of my neck and I made a bee-line for my bed, where I covered up from head to toe.  The next morning, I told my mom and dad what I saw (leaving out that its head appeared to be pointed and was darn near touching the top of the window).  My dad dismissed my story as that of having an over-active imagination and that no one could look into their bedroom as the window was too high off of the ground (approximately 7-ft.).  The person would need a step ladder to see in.  However, about this time in the neighborhood, the police were getting reports of a \\\"Peeping Tom\\\" but to my knowledge, no one was ever caught and the incidences stopped shortly thereafter. I know that this doesn't sound like much, but it made a deep impression on me.  As time has passed, I've learned what affect the sun can have on snow and how it can distort tracks in the snow.  However, this still doesn't explain to me how or why there were bare footprints with such a long stride in the snow.  Even if the sun had distorted them, it couldn't distort the stride or the depth.  I know what I saw and it wasn't normal.\", \"location_details\": \"Go East on Benton Ave. East to before it turns into old highway 34.

Terror tied her tongue. Her brother, who earlier that evening thought he had seen a large and hairy arm reach out from behind a cattle shed, sat at a table with a rifle ready. But he knew nothing of the kitchen scene beyond his view. Seconds passed - slowly, agonizing. The creature's eyes bored in on Dodrill. Frightened as she had never been before, she blinked but could not look away. After three minutes, Anna Dodrill screamed. The creature, whatever it was, fled into the darkness outside her farm home three miles northwest of here. \\\"It was the first time in my life I couldn't move,\\\" Dodrill said later. What she saw that night may have been Bigfoot, the beast rumored since July to be responsible for eerie night screams, broken fences, stampeded cattle, chewed-up cats, mangled rabbits and the death of a dog whose neck had been broken while it was chained near the home of its master. It - named or nameless, male or female or something biologically unknown - has been seen since. So have the terror and uncertainty. People here don't know what - if anything - is loose in the countryside. They don't know if they should lock their doors or laugh, buy weapons or rein in their imaginations. They don't know many things about what has happened. All they know is that something is different here. And they know, many of them children will not walk along at night until they know more. SIGHTED AGAIN Early, September 12, only 24 hours after the incident at the home of Anna and Jennings Dodrill, the creature was sighted again. Eighteen-year-old Robert Newell IV was dressing for work in a bedroom of the family home about two miles southeast of Ottosen. From out of the backyard came a deep whining sound. \\\"No horse or pig could have made it,\\\" Newell, a rock quarry worker, said later. He looked out the bedroom window toward the barn, located about 35 feet south of the house and illuminated by the yard lights. Newell said he saw a tall, hairy hunchbacked figure go into the barn. It jumped sideways into a manure spreader, got out and stood for a moment, then got into a grain spreader. Newell said the creature appeared to be looking for food. It then stood up in front of the barn for a short time, walked around a grain silo and headed south into a recently harvested cornfield. The whole episode lasted about 3 \\u00bd minutes. Newell said the creature was between six and seven feet tall, had black hair and walked quite fast on its hind legs. The experiences of Dodrill and Newell are the latest in a rash of such sightings that have occurred in and around Ottosen during the past two months. Since mid-July, the Humboldt and Kossuth county sheriff's offices have received numerous complaints from farmers and residents in the Ottosen, West Bend, and Homboldt area who have seen a large, hairy creature or have been awakened by strange screams and an eerie, high- pitched  whistle. Many in the area believe the creature - or creatures - is Bigfoot, a legendary, nocturnal primate that has been reported throughout history as occupying a position between ape and man. It is also known as Sasquatch, Yeti and the abominable snowman. HOAX There are those who adamantly disagree with the Bigfoot theory and explain the sightings as either an elaborate hoax or the figment of fertile imaginations. Whatever the case, the sightings have brought unusual pressures on this close-knit Humboldt County town of 135 persons. Alberta Bennett, wife of Ottosen Marshal Tom Bennett, said the situation has created a division in town between believers and non-believers. \\\"Its left a strange feeling in town\\\", she said. There has been the unusual humor that accompanies such sightings. Someone recently tracked another sign beneath the Ottosen sign on Highway 222, which skirts the town. The new sign reads \\\"Big Foot Country.\\\" A letter received last week at the post office was addressed to \\\"Bigfoot Country.\\\" Then there was the fellow who walked into the post office wearing a monkey mask. STRANGE FOOTPRINTS But the humor is checked by the stories related by those who gather at Twig's Grocery Store here. There, in addition to stories of mutilated animals, residents talk of being awakened by eerie screams in the night; of strange footprints two-hands wide by three-hands long; of unusual feces found in Marilyn Schmacher's lean-to; and of children so terrified by what they saw that they cannot sleep and who for days wouldn't walk the town's streets - even in the daytime. One man who has heard all these stories is Humboldt County Sheriff Marvin Andersen. \\\"I tell you, if you're a non believer after you talk to a few of these people, you have to believe there's something there,\\\" he said. \\\"I think those people have seen something, but I don't know if its this Bigfoot connection they are talking about.\\\" Andersen was first called to Ottsen in July when three boys, ages 10 to 12 came home terrified from something they'd seen near the sales barn at the edge of town. The boys had spied a cat that was bleeding and chased it up a tree near the barn. \\\"We heard this scratching noise come from the buildings, like something rubbing up against something.\\\" one of the boys said later. \\\"We tossed a rock into the building.\\\" When the rock cracked against the floor a face appeared in a window, the quickly disappeared. The boys told the sheriff it had a big, square, black head with a flat nose and broad shoulders. The boys bolted for home and the creature took off into a cornfield, they said. When Sheriff Andersen arrived in Ottsen he learned that this was not the first such incident. Days earlier, one of Jan Henkin's daughters left home about 11 p.m. to go to her grandmother's house about a block away. When the girl walked out of her grandmother's backdoor, she heard a noise and found herself face to face with the beast. She screamed and retreated into the house, where she told her two uncles about the incident. About a half hour later another of Henkins' daughters rode her bicycle uptown with two other girls.  They beat it back home when they spotted a figure five feet tall standing in front of a vacant lumber building. Henkins said she and a friend, Pat Young, went up to the main street to see what had frightened the girls and saw a hairy head looking out from behind one of the buildings. They quickly returned home and sent Henkins' brother and a friend uptown with a dog.  As the two men neared the building, they glimpsed what appeared to be a large animal.  Yelping, the dog charged out from behind the building and headed for home. Henkins said she saw the creature the following night when she and Young left Young's house to learn why the dogs were barking and saw the creature about one-block from the home.  When the creature took a step toward them, they retreated into another home. After that experience, Henkins sent her daughters to stay with a sister in Livermore for a couple of nights. \\\"My oldest daughter would wake up and just be shaking,\\\" she said. DELUGED WITH HUNTERS For several nights after the reports of those sightings were publicized, Ottosen was deluged with hunters and curiosity seekers from as far away as Davenport.  At night, the traffic on normally quiet streets was so heavy one woman complained to the sheriff's office that she couldn't cross the street in from of her home. Sheriff Anderson, who sent two deputies to patrol the town for a few nights, said at least one pickup load of gun-toting hunters was sent home. That situation and the ridicule many have received from skeptics have left Ottosen residents reluctant and embarrassed to discuss the sightings. \\\"People are afraid to say anything anymore,\\\" said Henkins, whose children and others have been ridiculed by classmates. But those who claim to have seen the beast remain adamant. \\\"I'm not a nut and I know what I saw,\\\" said Dodrill. Newell agreed: \\\"They'll ridicule about it until they're unlucky enough to see it themselves,\\\" he said. This past week reports of unusual animal sounds were filled with the sheriff by two farmers east of Ottosen and by a family that lives northeast of Humboldt.  In each case, farm dogs became restless but would not leave their yards to investigate.

The reason we had the camera with us was because the all the dogs in our town were going crazy the last few days and we had heard odd noises coming from down in these woods which were right along side the Des Moines River. We got extremely scared at the sight of this thing and took off running right after we flipped the camera light on to try to get it on tape. The next morning we went down to the same spot to try to find some evidence. We found nothing real important there except some broken twigs and what not. However a little ways away we found a large femur bone either from a cow or a human -- it was much to big to be a deer and wasn't a horse. This led us to dig around and we found 22 more bones. We also notices a bunch of fur around that area like rabbit or something. About a week later we went back during the day cause we were scared of night and found a deer dead with its rear bit completely off, shredded. We still have these bones and movie. We reported it to the police they said to give them the movie and bones. I was wondering if this would be the right thing to do.

I voted in the Idaho election at 8:00 a.m. Then I went straight home and loaded my two horses to go elk hunting for 3 days in the Big Hole Mountains east of where I live, approimately 25-30 miles away. I had camp all set up by noon, wo I decided to go for a horse ride and maybe hunt a little before dark. The creek drainage I planned to hunt was Big Burns Creek. I rode up this drainage as far as Bear Trap, the third canyon coming into this drainage from the west. I tied the horses up at the mouth of this canyon and decided to hunt for a few hours before it got dark on the ridge on the north side of Bear Trap and south of Temple Peak. I arrived back at the horses just as it was getting dark. I took my backpack off and tied it in the saddle of the horse I had ridden in on, so I wouldn't have to pack it going out. I slung my rifle over my shoulder and got on my second horse. I had ridden approximately 1/2 mile when the encounter took place. Riding south, with Big Burns Creek running parallel along my left side and making its normal loud babbling sounds cascading down over the many rocks, just as I was entering the confluence of where Little Burns Creek came down from the east at my left and entered into Big Burns Creek. I heard this very loud, voluminous, high pitched, slightly raspy scream. This scream completely over powered the noise coming from the creek. It screamed again again. Each scream lasted 3-4 seconds. The screams didn't noticebaly change in pitch or tone from beginning to end. It was just an intense scream like a large animal that had just been startled. My horse that had been following behind me, came trotting up to my right side about 3 yards away just beneath a tree. Both horses just stood there like a couple of statues, frozen in place. The air thermals were going down the two canyons, so these animals and my horses couldn't smell one another. My scent was drifting down and to the right because of the air coming from Little Burns Canyon, and their scent was being carried down and to the left because of the air coming down Big Burns Canyon. The animal doing the screaming was slightly to my left at approximately 40 yards standing right in the middle of Big Burns Creek. All that I was thinking was maybe I had just ridden into a Mountain Lion. A few years before a friend at work told me of a Whitetail Doe that screamed at him one afternoon on the river bottoms. I just couldn't put an animal with the scream. I think it was right after the second scream that I heard the sounds of the second animal. It was 40 to 50 yards east of the one doing the screaming. I heard a loud whistle followed by some 4-5 fast verbalizing grunts {agh ooh egh egh} The whistle it seemed to me was like a man would make if he laid his lower lip over his teeth and whistled to try and get somebody's attention clear across a canyon. This loud whistle and grunts also overpowered the sounds coming from both creeks. It seemed to me the second was communicating with the one doing the screaming. And I just couldn't put any animal with those sounds. I've hunted elk with the bow for many years and I think I've heard just about every sound an elk can possibly make. The whistle and grunts were not coming from an elk. Elk don't scream like the scream I was hearing. Big cats don't whistle and grunt like the sound I heard from the second one. By then I was wide awake and fully alert. I didn't have a light on my person. I had two lights in the left side pocket of my pack tied on the other horse. After much effort I was able to get the horse I was riding to break away from the trance he was in and move to my right up next to the other horse. I reached over and removed an energizer headlamp, and the Mini Mag flashlight which held two AA batteries. I fumbled around and got the headlamp put on and got both lights turned on. Looking down in the middle of the creek where the screaming was coming from there were the eyes of a predator {eyes coming out of the front of the head}. They seemed large because they were reflecting so much light back at me. They were reflecting exactly the same color that I was broadcasting out from my lights. The energizer headlamp was on the white diode mode and the mini mag flashlight had a slight yellow color to it. The eyes were reflecting mostly bright white with a slight tinge of gold. Having the lights turned on it didn't stop it from screaming. It continued to scream another 3-4 times while the lights were on it, for a total of 6-7 Loud screams. All the same volume, length, and intensity, etc. Although I was very concerned, I really wasn't teribbly afraid. My heart wasn't pounding with adrenilin and I didn't feel I was in a life threating situation, because the one doing the screaming stayed put and wasn't getting any closer and being aggressive. I felt more like I was the one scaring this animal. I must have blinked my eyes at just the right time, because all of a sudden the eyes disappeared and I didn't see which direction it went. I sat there looking and listening for about 2 more minutes. Hearing and seeing nothing more I thought whatever it was had probably left the area. I kicked my horse to go on down the trail. He didn't want to move. I gently talked to him telling him its OK, and kept kicking and encouraging him. I think he could still see something out there in the dark that I couldn't see. He finally started down the trail. I still had my lights on and kept looking at the edge of the creek nearest me, which was about 10-15 yards away. I expected something to jump out of the creek toward me any second. When I had traveled down the trail about the 40 yards or so I looked up on the other side of the creek. There standing side-by-side at approximately 25-30 yards were two sets of eyes. My guess is that the one doing the whistle and grunts came down the 40-50 yards to help the frightenned screaming one. When it arrived the screaming stopped and it got out on the bank with its buddy. The eyes seemed to be about level with my eyes as I sat on the horse. But my two lights didn't have enough candle power to see the outline of bodies with the eyes. I also couldn't see how high or low the bank was which they were standing on or any of the brush and trees which I knew was on the other side of the creek. One of the sets of eyes was higher up than the other. I sat there on the horse staring at the two sets of eyes for about 1 full minute. Then the one on my right slowly turned to it's left and verified to me that it was the eyes of a predator. Its left eye slowly narrowed to its right eye and disappeared almost at the same time as the right eye. Then the one on my left turned and followed behind the first. I sat on the horse for a couple more minutes looking for any glint of eyes as they moved away from me but I never saw them again. It's now the 4th of May 2007. When it first happed I had no idea what had happened to me. When I returned home and called by son to tell him about it. He flat out told me I had an encounter with a couple of sasquatches. He has been reading on the BFRO site for quite a few years. I being a slow learner was quite skeptical. I talked to every Mountain Lion hunter I could think of, to pick their brains as to what sounds they would make. Including Fish and Game personnel. This just left me as frustrated as before I talked to them. So before I thought I was going completely crazy, I gave Jeff Meldrum of Pocatello a call. I felt like what I'd heard and seen was not a great surprise to him for he had heard similar stories many times. After the first of this year 2007, my son told me of two sightings in Idaho on the web site. One in Northern Idaho and the second in the same time frame as mine within a few days and only 20-25 miles south of my encounter and east of Idaho Falls. My son then let me read Jeff Meldrum's book that he received for Christmas entitled \\\"Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science\\\" and I learned more about what evidence they have for the existence of these animals, including one thing that might have made my horses act the stupified way they did. When I talked to Dr. Meldrum I told him I was going to return first thing in the spring to the site to check for carrion to confirm Mountain Lions or not. My son and I took a horses to ride back up there on the 29th of April, nearly 5 months later than the incident and before the high water runoff could wash away any evidence. I took 3 pictures, one from where my horses and I first heard the screaming, etc. and two pictures from where I watched them across the creek. I had my six foot son stand in two different clearing places they could have been standing on the far bank. The one on the north side of a tree with thick brush and one on the south side of the tree. My sons head was level with mine while I was on the trail sitting atop my horse when standing on the north side of the tree. And the south side where I found a breakaway portion of the overhanging bank and the only possible footprint just next to it on the south side of the breakaway, where I thought the animal climbed up on the bank out of the creek. My sons head was about a foot lower than mine while I sat on the horse. If the south of the tree was where they were standing side-by-side, that would make them in the 7-8 foot height range. The heel portion of the right foot was quite visible but when I first noticed it I was facing the creek on top of the overhanging bank. I looked to the side of the breakaway and noticed the back heel portion of the print about 4 1/2 to 5 inches in front of my right boot. I wear a 10 1/2 to 11 glove size and this heal print was about the size of my fist. The depth of the heel print was about 1 inch deep with the rest of the print coming straight back up along the side my boot. When I realized what I had just done my heart jumped right up in my throat. As I lifted by foot out of the track it looked as if my boot heel was just about where the toe prints might have been if I hadn't stepped on it. I measured by boot length when I got home and it was 11 1/2 inches Long. Which would have make the track 16-17 inches long. I've heard the expression of putting one's foot in his mouth but I really felt awful when I realized I'd just screwed up the only possible track that we found by putting my foot in it. And that, as they say, is about the size of it. At first I thought I was loosing my mind cause I couldn't place those sounds with any animal I'd ever heard. But now, after learning all I could about these animals for the last 5 months,  I'm better than 95% sure I've been one of the lucky humans to have had an enoucter with these elusive creatures. And I wouldn't have traded this experience for the Biggest Bull Elk in Idaho.\", \"location_details\": \"To get to the location of the encounter, you would drive east of Ririe turning North to cross the river West of Heise Hot Springs.

We got there around 2-3 in the afternoon. We set up our tents started a fire and we just sat around the fire talking until around 5. Then we decided to hike to the south east point of the rivers bend nearest to us. The hike there we had to go through lots of willows, brush,trees etc.. On the way there we ran into a cow moose and it had a calf moose with it. It was an intense stare down as I was not even 15 feet away from it and I could see it's hair on its back intensely sticking up as I started to move me and my friends around her. We got around here and ran into a young bull moose and found an old fallen down cabin. By the time we were done exploring around there we moved forward to the rivers end of the bend. I was at the front walking up on the bend point, it was thick with willows up until 15 feet from the flowing rivers water. That 15 feet was just pure sand all at the tip of this bend. I started to walk to the river's edge when I seen some huge prints walking out of the water up on to the sand bank about 8ft out of from the waters edge and then it walked slowly back into the water. It was one of the biggest most bizarre tracks I've seen and how they moved in and back in the water was just weird. I counted 10-11 tracks coming out of the water and back in the water. I wear size 12 shoe and my foot next to its foot made mine look small. It was approx 19in long and it looked just like \\\"a huge human footprint huge\\\". Its strides were over double mine and Im 6ft.

He said no I'm serious. Then I could tell he was. I rose up and about 20 yards away I seen somebody or something look out from behind this cottonwood tree. The only weapon we had was a bow and arrow and I didnt feel real safe. I said real loud grab your GUN and then I repeated weve got GUNS.

The ranch itself sits about 30 miles outside of Dubois near the Continental Divide.  I am an avid fisherman and after working long days on the ranch I would spend many evenings fly-fishing along Medicine-Lodge Creek. One night as I was fishing, a rainstorm quickly moved in over the divide ( as is common in the summer months).  I decided to start walking back to the ranch, to avoid getting soaked. I had been fishing on the opposite side of the river from the ranch and therefore had to cross back through the river to return home.  I walked the banks of the river for a few minutes in order to find an ideal crossing spot.  I finally found a break in the willows and started wading across the river.  By this time it had started to rain and a cold, dreary feeling had set in over the river.  As I was wading across the river I saw a slight movement above me in the river.  I turned my head and froze immediately.  At first I thought I wall looking at a moose or even a bear which are both common to the area. The creature was probably 200 ft above me in the river. I was scared to death, and could not move.  Then the unthinkable happened.  The creature, which had previously been hunched over slightly, stood up on two legs and looked directly at me.  It was then that it occured to me that I was looking at the infamous sasquatch.  One of the things I remember that was striking was how human-like the creature's face was.  It was much darker obviously, but very much human.  It had broad shoulders, although so do I, I am 6'6\\\" and 300 lbs. (I have recounted this story to many people who have joked that I saw my reflection in the river).  I remember thinking that the sasquatch was not as hairy as I would have thought and that it was not as tall as I had ever imagined.  After what seemed an eternity, the sasquatch, started to walk into the willows.  As soon as I saw movement I began to run across the river (as fast as I could in waders and in water).  When I got to the bank I took a glance behind me to make sure the sasquatch hadn't circled around to come after me, after seeing that it hadn't I took my waders off and sprinted back to the ranch.  I will never forget this experience. I have had many friends try and discount it and talk me out of what I saw--I will never change my story.\", \"location_details\": \"Take 1-15 North aprox. 60 miles from Idaho Falls to Dubois.

My father, brother and I were camped at the head of Swampy Draw on Pleasant Valley creek during the cow elk muzzle loader season. Camp location: 16.5 miles N by NW of Dubois Idaho as the crow flies. Camp was at 7,054 ft elevation. General topography is pine covered mountainsides with grassy / mixed alder brush and sage brush valley floors. We had been hunting elk and deer for 5 days and saw lots of deer on the hillside above camp ~ 250 yards away (from range finder) and a few elk. After spending days exploring around the area we decided to hunt the deer right at camp. My father is 83 and walks with a cane so he hunts close to camp. For the evening hunt my father walked up the hill behind camp ~100 yards and my brother positioned himself a few hundred yards along the base of the hillside. I decided to take my atv up swampy draw and sit at the head of it for the evening. That way we would have a fairly large area covered. Swampy Draw has an old logging road right up the middle of it but the access from Pleasant Valley is difficult. I managed to get up the road on my atv leaving camp at 2:30pm as I wanted to be in hunting position early and let the area quiet down way before prime hunting hours. Prior to the evening hunt I explored a skid road that climbed the east side of the draw and hooked north toward camp. The climb disturbed the area so I headed back down to the main logging road then turned up to the head of Swampy Draw and positioned myself for the evening hunt. At 6:15pm I saw 2 figures coming up the trail towards me at approximately 200 yards. I thought it was 2 hunters that were blowing my evening hunt. But as they came into full view I saw that they were black in color. Most hunters in the area have some sort of blaze orange on them or are dressed in camo. These figures were not dressed. They were walking side by side and I suspect they were a male and female pair although the distance was too great to identify sex. I estimate the height of one at approximately 8 foot and the other 7-1/2 foot. I could not see any facial features at my observation distance. My overall impression was that they were incredibly tall and rather slender. As they saw me they turned to my left and disappeared into timbered hill side. As they turned and walked into the timber I saw very long arms, almost to the knees. They swung their arms in fairly long arcs as they walked; much like a human power walker. It was then that I remembered that I had left my 454 Casull pistol in camp and only had the single shot 54 cal muzzle loader with me. A over sight I will never duplicate. The whole sighting took approximately 20 seconds. Since the creatures were between myself and camp with only one way out I waited 10 min for them to hopefully clear the area. I put my rifle across my lap and headed back to camp. Distance to camp was only a bit over a half mile. Half way to camp I came across a road block on the trail in a small creek that had not been there when I came in. The creatures had picked up a large log and placed it in the creek to block my way. As it was getting dark, with a bit of adrenaline and heavy handed throttle I managed to climb my ATV over the smaller end of the tree. The next day I went back to the barricade only to find that during the night the creatures had improved on their efforts and completely blocked the trail with additional logs and stumps. The logs that they placed in the trail were too heavy for 3 men to pick up and I could find no evidence of dragging. They were picked up and carried, an enormous feat. To make the story a bit weirder, my father kept talking about a stick fort that some kids must of made about 200 yards from camp at the base of the hill. My brother said it must have been made by some Boy Scouts. But nobody uses the area. I went and found the stick structure and it was clearly evident that it was not man made. The main structural tree was pulled down in an arc and no 3 men would have the strength to perform the task. Masses of sticks were then woven into the frame to produce a hollow area approximately 6 feet by 12 feet. My father said it looked like it had been recently used. I think that the course of events were as follows. I came up the logging road on my ATV, explored the spur road that climbed the hill toward camp and close above the stick structure. I disturbed the creatures and they built the barricade. Then they came up the road and showed themselves to me as if to say \\u2013 Hey here we are and you should not be. I never went past the barricade again. I looked very closely for foot prints but could not find any clear prints in the hard gravelly ground. Of note: The evening of the sighting my brother and father counted over 30 deer on the hillside in the area of the structure. After my sighting we saw no more deer during the 4 days we continued hunting. Also during the night I heard my horse trailer tack door open and shut which I thought was odd. I stored the camp food in the tack room and nothing was missing. I know I had the door tightly shut in case of the odd bear wandering into camp. It takes fingers to work the latch and the door was not latched when I found it in the morning. A bit about me: I am 62 years old and have spent a lifetime hunting and fishing in the wilds. Mostly Montana, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, Alaska and Northern Minnesota. I have had other what I believe were close encounters but this is the only time I have clearly observed the creatures.

I was just gazing out the window wind I saw what looked like a bigfoot walk out of the tall weeds upon the hill. He (or she) but my senses tells me it was a he. He sensed me looking at him immediately. He waived his hand as if he was saying forget about you.. he continued to walk behind the barn on his merry way. I never looked at him anymore. I could tell immediately he didn't want me looking at him. I never pursued it any further. I've never seen another one since this. My husband thought I was nuts and ignored me. I didn't talk to anyone about it for years, but now that the monsters, finding bigfoot shows are on, my husband now believes they really exist. The one I saw was as shiney black as could be, looked very clean and neat as if his hair had been combed. His hair was all over his body but his face was a bit different than some of these on tv. He was more black like leather around his eyes and mouth. His hair neatly laid around his face. My guess he was approximately 8 or 9 ft tall. He looked more muscled not rugged at all. I live by a bottom which many of us that has lived here all our lives have known of some wild species seen down there. I've been told including devil worshipers. A friend and a buddy of his took the dogs to hunt down in the bottom one night and they smelled an awful smell and the dogs turned around and ran home fast as they could..so of course they ran home fast as they could. He commented it scared him to death! These boys hunted all the time and I believe this incident stopped their hunting altogether. I don't know if anyone else has ever seen bigfoot. It used to be no big deal to go into the woods at night around here but most people dont do that anymore. Only some 4wheelers possibly. Well I also live near Washington County lake in Nashville, IL.

I got a good closeup view of these things, they are freaking huge and I don't want to mess with them. After I flashed the camera it looked at me. So I went and got my mom up and I am like \\\"Mom, just get the gun, it's going to come through the wall.\\\" They knocked that tree down and went back out into the woods. I went out the next day and found a lot of tracks and there were a lot of walnuts that had been cracked open. I honestly think this thing is stalking our woods out here, I think we have a lot of deer activity, I think it is chasing the deer around. My brother is like 6'8\\\" and weighs 350 lbs and I think they are intimidated by him. My brother had caught the chainsaw blade in the tree. My brother took the motor part of and had left the chain and bar stuck in the tree. That morning I found the bar laying away from the tree, like it had been taken out of the tree but the chain was still stuck in the tree. It had been a few days from when we got the blade stuck and the tree was pushed over. The tree is about 100 feet from my bedroom window. I've got lots of pictures of footprints. I've went out there walking the dogs, I won't go out there by myself. There were also a bunch of tracks. Its muddy around it. I did hear a strange sound while outside it kinda sounded like a cow but it was like a growl at the same time, it was so loud it was like it shook the house. It was during the day I was out on the deck but after I heard that I went in quick.\", \"location_details\": \"Near Lake Lou Yeager\", \"county\": \"Montgomery County\", \"state\": \"Illinois\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 39568.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"My mother observed a large, beige creature at the edge of a woods area, about 1000 yards from our house.

My mum was talking on the phone to her mum, and our dogs, (beagles) set up a terrible racket. She walked to the edge of the screen porch and saw an animal crouched down. Thinking it was maybe a bear (none in area) she asked her mum what it could be. The dogs barked and howled, but did not go any nearer than 500 feet to animal. The inside dogs were yelping and howling too. Suddenly, the creature straightened upright and looked toward the house.

We did not see the front end of the animal, we could only see from about the mid chest down. The creature was up on its hind legs and seemed to be stooped over.

George Field was a WWII air base for pilot training & the barracks housed airmen and brass. After the war the Barracks were converted to civilian apartments & my family lived in one. George Field was in an extremely remote area between Vincennes, Indiana & Lawrenceville, Illinois. The Wabash River was east close to Vincennes and the Embrass River was west - the rivers approximately 20-30 miles apart. The Barracks were surrounded by miles of corn and wheat fields. Often during the night I heard high pitched screams like a woman being attacked or killed. My parents told me the screams were panthers \\u2013 I never saw any panthers. My sisters and I walked the corn and wheat fields as often as we could. Old timers told us to be careful of the \\u201cGrassman\\u201d which I later learned was their name for Big Foot. I thought Grassman was like the Wizard of Oz Scarecrow. One night my parents went out and left me with my older sister (who has since passed away). She was always teasing, aggravating and pulling pranks on anyone foolish to fall for her drama! That night she came close and said to me \\u201cJudy, there is something outside the window. Seriously, there is a monster outside came to the window \\u2013 listen, you can hear it.\\u201d To shut her up I moved to the window and listened. (Our windows were usually open because we had no air-conditioning) I could hear something large moving around and saw a large head in the shadows. It walked around all the windows trying to look in and went from the back of the house to the front. Meanwhile, our middle sister came home \\u2013 I knew she\\u2019d be coming in the front door where the monster was. I gathered all my nerve, opened the front door, turned on the porch light and screamed to my sister there was danger out there. I found myself looking eyeball to eyeball with the \\u201cMonster\\u201d. I am now 71 years old and know it was Bigfoot, which I didn\\u2019t know at the time. It had honey blonde hair and beautiful amber colored eyes. We startled each other, but it had an \\u201cOh Shit\\u201d look on it\\u2019s face. My sister who had just returned home came running toward it and it turned to leave. My sister and I looked at each other for a second and \\u201cBigfoot\\u201d was gone \\u2013 disappeared instantly.

I asked her if she ever told our parents or anyone and she said \\u201cno, she had also forgotten about it.\\u201d How can this be after 61 years?

I went and reported it when it happened to the local police but they didn't make an official report because of the circumstances, this happened back in 1978. I was a teletype operator in the United States Air Force, I was a crypto guy, we monitored Russian and Chinese teletype. In 1978 I had just come out of tech school and went back home to Southern Illinois, where I was raised. The reason I found you was through some other guys website who had something to do with Southern Illinois University in Edwardwardville. I grew up in East St.Louis, which is four miles south of Monk's Mound, Cahokia Mound. I went home on leave in 1978, the fall of '78. I have a top secret clearance, in fact I went one above top secret my last year of the service overseas. So I was very leery of saying anything. I was just on my way up to visit a friend one morning, on home on leave, I had my dad's car, he's at work. I'm driving up to the campus, up on University Drive, and there is a little old church (St. Paul's United Church Of Christ) right there on the frontage road, right before you head up into the bluffs, into the university proper. I had driven down there, for some reason, just to see what was down there, I had never driven down there before. It was a kind of foggy morning, kind of misty and rainy, there is nothing behind this old church other than a bunch of hay fields, there were a bunch of hay rings where the guy had just drug through and done the hay thing.  I'm driving down the road, I was going to turn around in the grass behind the church and I see this bear way down on the dirt road and it is bent over splashing water in a puddle in the middle of the road. As I pull down closer to this thing, it's not a bear and it is huge. I bring my car within about ten yards of it and then veer off into the field, and get out with my door between me and the thing. And, it stands up and it's like eight or nine feet tall, it looked like a black humanoid. I grew up in Southern Illinois, I am a hunter, my dad was a hunter. I had a goose gun in the trunk. I get the gun out. Something in my head clicked and I'm thinking, of course there were all these stories about these things up by Alton, Illinois but I had never really heard anything about my area. But something in my head clicked, I remember hearing about bigfoot in California, and I thought \\\"This is one of those bigfoots and I am going to wound this thing and Barnum & Bailey here I come\\\". I shot off with this goose gun to the left of this thing, and it didn't move, and then I shot off to the right and it didn't move again. Something inside of me said \\\"You can't hurt this thing and if you try to hurt it, it is only going to hurt you.\\\" And with that it shrugged, what it looked like it's shoulders at me and it binged off into the woods that are just north of that road. And each one of its leaps, bings, jumps, whatever it was 15 to 20 feet at a time and it was gone. Well, I completely freaked out, I went into the local gas station and washed my face off, and I drove right into Edwardsville and to the Madison County Sheriff's office and there was an old time deputy, and he looked at me after I told him the whole thing and he said \\\"You know I would think you were crazy or on drugs if it weren't for the fact that I have heard this same story in the last couple of weeks, and three of them were from good friends of mine who were out hunting and saw the same thing you did. If I was you, knowing the kind of job you got and you're getting ready to do I wouldn't tell anybody about this for a long time, and you would be a lot better off.\\\" And that was probably the most sound advice I ever got, because if I had told somebody about this they would have jerked my clearance and messed me around in the Air Force.\", \"location_details\": \"From I-270 take Exit 9.

I lived a block West from railroad tracks, which ran North/South, and about 1/2 mile North of my home was the edge of a wooded bottomland which is referred to as Middle Fork, which runs into the Big Muddy River to the West, and has an abandoned railroad bed running West/East just inside the woodline.  The edges of which were littered with dumped appliances, etc., that the garbage service wouldn't take.  I had heard of the reports of the Big Muddy Monster prior but didn't give it alot of thought at the time. Inside the edge of the woodline mentioned there is an abandoned railroad bed (no rails, etc., and as you travel along it becomes raised to a point of about 10 feet at the end where it runs into a field and drops abruptly) which \\\"us kids\\\" used as a bicycle / motorcycle trail.  One day nearing dusk I was riding my bike through the neighborhood and decided to go down the trail.  On the trail you could either go North into the woods or South back into the residential area.  As I was turning onto the path a pair of kids came out on their motorcycle.  As they passed the driver yelled, \\\"There's a hobo chasing us!\\\", and they continued on.  There was a hobo village nearby, but it was on the East side of the tracks and farther North, and I had never been bothered by them before so I figured the kids were messing with me. I turned onto the trail and went West, toward the field wanting to make a circle back to the residential area.  At about midpoint on the trail, which is about 6 ft. above the ground on either side, I approached a place where some washers and dryers had been dumped.  Behind one of the washers, which was on it's side, I could see the outline of a \\\"person\\\".  I came to a stop as the thing stood up it came to where at full up it was looking me in the eye from about 20 ft. away.  I could make out the outline and see that it's groin had cleared the washer and that it was covered in hair.  There was a slight breeze and I could see the hair moving somewhat in the wind.  The sun was to it's back and cast a shadow on it's face but I could make out the shine in it's eyes.  I could tell where the nose and lips were but not with any great detail.  I do not remember seeing ears.  I did not smell anything.  It was broad built, what I could see, and the arms were long.  It had a small head but I could not tell if it held it's head upright or slightly down. When it became erect it reached up with it's right hand/arm and grabbed a sappling near it.  As it grabbed the tree it grunted slightly, like as in disgust, not mean, and then shook the tree.  Not vigorously but it shook it easy enough.  With that I turned back East and took off with all I had. As I exited the trail nearing a road I slowed and turned to look back.  The creature had walked up onto the trail looking at me.  It then turned and walked back into the treeline and I took off home. After telling my friends, they all thought I was \\\"nuts\\\", unitl they started to hear of other acounts, both prior to mine, and after...then nothing more was ever said. I went back to area a few years later and back to the spot of the sighting.  I am 6 ft. tall and using the surrounding trees, estimated the creature's height at 7 to 7 1/2 feet. The area of my sighting has since been built up somewhat and cleared out but still exists as it did for the most part.

And that is where the creature was standing. It stood out because it was standing in front of the background of the trees and the brush. As the headlights hit it, then is when you seen the movement, then it turned and looked at us.

And it looked just like a grape vine had moved briefly up the side of the tree. Then I seen a bigger part of it step out from the tree. I seen its knee and its shoulder and went on up and seen its face, which was hairy from top to bottom. I didn't see anything that would resemble a flesh tone. It was black. I saw it's eyes blink. It had white around it's eye, I could see that part. I guess there might have been lighter and darker colors on its face but it was all hairy.

In particular, the area of Jackson Co. and the town of Murphysboro. The sightings also included Carbondale. The (for lack of a better term) \\\"creature\\\" or \\\"creatures were seen, heard, and even smelled for quite a few years. Although sightings have declined or stopped completely there are still plenty of local people who recall the reports as well as the fear they felt during this time. Although some of the finer points of the reports differ there remain some aspects that coincide. Such as: It seems as though the creature used the river (The Big Muddy River) as its main travel way. Most of the incidents occured either around the river or on the river itself. Perhaps the creature used the river not only as a path but also for water and a possible food supply. And a particular point of interest in this case is the fact that this creature was always accompanied by a foul, sour smell. In fact, most reports have the people actually smelling the creature before seeing it. Also my personal favorite aspect of this group of stories is the fact that although confronted with people many times this creaure never became violent or acted in a hostile manner. The differing aspects of this group of  sightings include the color, and size. Some have the color being anywhere from black to brown to reddish. Mostly it was a dirty brownish color and always the hair was matted with mud and plant material no matter the color. Size was estimated from 4 foot to the incredible size of 7 foot tall and weighing somewhere between 120 up to 300 lbs. Most have the creature being the size of a big boned man around 6 foot 4. Even though there were never creatures or even a family group could help explain the many different sizes and colors of the creature. Along with the different light settings and the distances from the creature to the veiwer. Also, as with anything people can't see or understand or fear they will make fun and make up their own stories as a joke. Since the sightings always seemed to originate around the vicinity of the Big Muddy River, the creature was quickly dubbed \\\"The Big Muddy Monster\\\" (I worked in a screen printing shop for a while and even years after the sightings we still made Big Muddy Monster T-shirts for the local retailers!). Supposedly, there is at least one article in one of the local papers about all the sightings and an actual warning for those going around the river. I have not seen this yet. I have just started looking, but too many people remember it for it not to be true.The most prolific sighter was an older man who owned a junkyard close to the river. This man was not only the most frequent veiwer but also as far asI can tell the first to encounter the creature first hand. It seems that the man was smelling something rotton in the junkyard and while searching for the smell made the first sighting of the creature. The man became quite used to the creature being there. And after several reports were made and no follow ups on the reports by local authorities the man just co-existed with the creature. Just staying out of the junkyard when he smelled that smell. He also told of many vocalizations ranging from the grunt up to a howl hitting all points in between. Another main story that was repeated over and over was about two men racoon hunting in the river bottoms. It seems as though the hunters dogs got on the trail of the creature and tracked it to an old barn in a field in the bottoms. The men, although armed with small caliber rifles, decide not to gointo the barn when they heard low pitched growling. They said they have been in the woods for years and had never heard anything like that before. One of the men tried to get his dogto go in and it refused so he picked it up and threw it into the open door of the barn. The man said that the dog barely had time to hit the ground when a high pithed shreik rang out and the dog bolted for the cover of the woods with the men close behind running for their truck. With sunrise and another dose of courage and more friends and weapons the hunters returned to the barn to find nothing but foot prints that followed them to the edge of the road where their truck had been the night before. Maybe for an instant the hunters became the hunted. I realize that with all stories the myths and legends grow. The fish that gets away gets bigger and the monster always gets scarier. I've tried to tell the stories as I've heard them. In this small little town you'll find those who believe as well as those who don't. But those who have seen ... have seen.

It was very hot outside and we had been in a long drought. The nearest town is Makanda IL. The nearest road is Progress Lane which is off of Water V vcalley road. I believe it is near Union county. I had been told from a friend about some weird creature he had seen in the woods around this area. He claimed to have seen it once directly and heard it stalking him another time. He never said he thought it was a Bigfoot but I was still curious so I went out there to look around and see what he was talking about. He had told me that he had been out there many times and most of the time there was nothing strange. However, his girlfriend\\u2019s grandfather had told him that there were weird creatures out in the woods. He described them to me as being 7 to 8 feet tall with glowing eyes and only moved at night for the most part. I have never seen any creatures out there but on one of my several trips out there in search of anything weird I could find I came upon a few trees with branches that had been snapped. I\\u2019m 6\\u20194 and 230lbs and tried hanging on limbs in similar trees and couldn\\u2019t even come close to breaking them. I took pictures of one of the trees with my friend who is 5\\u20193 standing next to the broken branches for reference. I thought that it was awfully strange that they were broken the way they were. It was as if something had broken them. We kept walking through the woods and about 10 yards past the trees with broken limbs; we found a poorly crafted hut. It was just big enough for me (being 6\\u20194) to fit in. It was made out of very large logs and tree limbs. They were big enough that I couldn\\u2019t move them at all. They were leaned together perfectly to create a shelter. While I was sitting in this shelter wondering how it could have been put together so well so far out in the woods I noticed a path leading out of it and into the woods. I followed the path and it led me to a place where water runs to when it rains to form a watering hole. I walked back to the shelter and took a picture of it. Sadly it isn\\u2019t a great one but I know it is still standing and can walk to it. It began to get dark and so we headed back to the truck and left. It was months later I saw an episode of Finding Bigfoot where Matt and Bobo found something very similar to what I found only the one I found was much bigger. It occurred to me that my friend who told me about the weird creatures and personal experiences I have been told relates to the behavior of Bigfoots. While investigating more about this area and its history, I found a map of the area in which all this occurred and the area was very close to a lake that I fish often with a friend. On several of our fishing trips we would stay out late after dark and catfish. While we were fishing those nights we kept hearing very strange sounds coming out of the woods. They were strange enough that both of us were a bit nervous about them because out of all of our fishing trips we had never heard these sounds. Shortly after we talked about them and kind of brushed it off as \\u201cthe woods\\u201d we heard a giant splash in the water, as if a big rock was thrown at us. It was close enough to us that I jumped grabbed our spotlight and tried to see what happened. It sounded like it was within 30 or 40 feet of us but I couldn\\u2019t see anything. I remember joking about it being Bigfoot trying to warn us away from his area then hearing more strange noises and another giant splash. It was a slightly windy night and very dark and with only one light I couldn\\u2019t see where the splash came from or anything in the woods. Shortly after that we decided it was time to call it a night and left. This happened on at least 3 occasions in about a month\\u2019s time. Every time the conditions were the same, it was a cool night slightly windy and very dark. The lake we were on was Little Grassy Lake. In the area of the lake we were on there are many lily pads and a large area of very shallow water. On those nights we thought we could hear something moving around in the water but it was far enough away that the spotlight couldn\\u2019t reach it. We stopped fishing there because the water level dropped so low that there was no water to fish in or even to put a boat during the rest of the year. The incident at the lake took place in early April of 2012. It was during the summer of 2012, only a few months later, that I found the shelter and broken tree limbs. The way it looks to me is that a Bigfoot was in the area at the time of the fishing trips. There was plenty of water, food and shelter in an unpopulated rural area. When the summer came we experienced the longest drought in over 50 years. It would make sense to me that the Bigfoot would move to a different location because all the water in the area dried up. When I was out there was in September of 2012 I was taking my friends out there to show them the shelter and see if it was still there. While standing in a nearby graveyard I heard a large amount of chattering. I couldn\\u2019t determine where it was coming from but it was like voices off in the distance. At first I thought I had to be people talking, but as I walked around trying to find them I realized I couldn\\u2019t understand anything being said no matter how close the voices sounded. While watching an episode of Finding Bigfoot I heard them talk about Bigfoots chattering and how it sounded like people that you couldn\\u2019t understand. I believe that there are Bigfoot that inhabit this area. I went out again March 1st, 2013 at about 11pm to try and do a night trip. I had never been out at night and wanted to try and see if I could find anything different than what I had already found.  We walked about a mile and a half out into the woods staying near a beaten path.  After we reached a certain point where the woods open up a bit we went off the path and started wandering.  We took a break and were standing quietly talking about where to go next or if we should stay.  It was lightly snowing and very cold so we weren\\u2019t sure how much longer we wanted to stay being as it was already 2:30am.  While standing there I was talking to my friend who is a marine and another guy said \\u201cis that a\\u2026 moan?\\u201d we stopped instantly and all 4 of us hear loud groaning or moaning sound.  Its hard to describe but it put all of us on edge as it stopped.  We decided to continue searching around a little longer and we walked down along the edge of the woods and I shined my light into the woods maybe 50 yards (not 100% sure on distance) away from where we were when we heard the moan only 5 minutes before.  When I shined my light into the woods I say what seemed to be a thumbtack on a tree, there are many thumbtacks on trees in  this area and I\\u2019m not sure why.  As I watched to make sure it was a thumbtack a head turned and looked at me and I could clearly make out two eyes.  I stared at them and they stared back and I said \\u201cguys\\u2026 guys\\u2026 I see eyes are you seeing this?\\u201d  My friends ran back to me, I never took my eyes off of the eyes, my marine friend made it to me first and the eyes were still just staring at me.  As he started looking for them and more flashlights were turned on I watched as the head disappeared behind the tree it was standing next to. I have seen many eyes from deer having grown up in southern Illinois and these just didn\\u2019t seem like deer eyes.  The way they were positioned on the head wasn\\u2019t right.  They were closer together than deer eyes.  Usually deer will run when there are multiple people moving around them as closely as we were.  The eyes seemed to be about 40 feet away and it was like they sidestepped behind the tree, never looking away from me.  I\\u2019m not sure if they can but I have never seen a deer sidestep.  The eyes seemed to be 5 to 6 feet off the ground.  I was also looking downhill at them.  I went into the woods within 45 seconds of them going behind the tree and never heard anything run away but we were unable to move through the woods quietly at all. When we reached the tree I believed they went behind there was nothing there and we could find no tracks in the half snow half dead leaf covered ground.  At this point it was nearly 3 and we decided to start making our way back.  What I believe happened is that a Bigfoot saw us up the hill and made a call which was the moaning sound we all heard.  I don\\u2019t know that was I saw was a Bigfoot but I can\\u2019t explain it saying it was for anything else either.  I find it hard to believe a deer would have acted the way what I saw did.  The eyes didn\\u2019t seem like a deer but there are no other animals in this area that have eyes that big that could be that far off the ground.  The angle of the head wasn\\u2019t right for it to be an animal like a raccoon on the tree.  It was as if something peaked out as we were walking by and I just happened to see it. The eyes stayed in sight for maybe 45 seconds and disappeared behind back behind the tree and the height of the head never changed. The next night I went out with almost the same group of people.  We got there at 1:30am and left at roughly 4am. It was much colder and not snowing.  We walked the same path we did the night before.  All the way to the spot where we heard the moan the night before it sounded like something was moving through the woods.  At first I didn\\u2019t think anything of it but we walked for a solid mile and constantly heard something moving to our left. The two people in the back occasionally claimed to hear something on the right that sounded almost like a pig snorting or a horse sighing heavily.  I never heard these things but I was also at the front of the line and 15 feet in front of them.  I almost turned around and left several times because I had the strong feeling something was stalking us.  Constant twig snaps and I heard one woodknock all from the left side of the path. Like I said we walked at least a mile and I heard these things the entire way.  Once we reached the area where we had heard the moan the night before we heard nothing.  We stayed and walked around the area just as we did the night before and heard nothing and saw nothing and after the cold really started to get to us we decided to leave. It was not as interesting as the night before that but the sounds from the woods were very strange to say the least. I\\u2019ve been in the woods, those woods, many times and haven\\u2019t heard the twig snaps or a woodknock before and I\\u2019d never had such a feeling of being followed/watched.\", \"location_details\": \"Its hard to explain how to get there unless you know the area.

Well guess what, I was just watching TV and they just ran a story about the same monster that I had encountered while I was going to Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, Illinois.  I was the bartender at the Midland Inn in Murphysboro, Illinois. This thing was in the wooded area behind where I was fishing. I kept hearing the brush breaking behind me but thought it was squirrels or deer or turkey. Then it started breaking whole trees, snapping them like they were twigs. I started getting very scared as the area I was fishing was miles from my truck or any roads. you had to trek in. Then a huge chunk of rock splashed into the water in front of me, then another. I turned around and it was standing there looking very pissed off that I was there. It immediately let out a scream. I can still imitate this scream. It starts out as a high pitched siren type scream that makes every hair on your body stand up. Then it gets higher pitched and is so loud you cant believe what is happening. With one step this thing could have reached out and twisted my head right off my shoulders. I knew I could not out run it so I just froze. I could not believe what was happening or what I was seeing. This thing was 5 feet wide at the shoulders. I was on the lower side of the hill so I could not get a real good estimate on height but I'm going to say it had to be at least 7 feet high. Nothing but pure muscular athletic bodybuilder outlined upper torso. A couple seconds after it screamed I was trying to think of an escape and turned away from it. It retreated back into the woods so fast that I lost sight of it against the wooded background almost immediately. I grabbed whatever gear I could and started running back down the trail as fast as I could. I don't know what I left there or what I took with me. I ran as far as I could until all I could do was a fast jog all the way back to the car. I was playing rugby for SIU at the time and was in pretty good physical shape. The whole time I was running I was thinking that it could have over took me at any time. There is more to this story. I had been fishing for bass with large shiner minnows for a couple hours. I was hearing something behind me in the brush. I kept fishing, something was stealing my bait off the hook time after time but I could never hook anything. A fat black water moccasin surfaced around the bank so I switched hooks to a #5 treble hook and snagged it. When I set it down on the bank and beat its head in with a stick, That's when all hell broke loose. To me it seemed that the creature was watching me the whole time I was fishing. After I killed the snake and wrapped it around a branch I pinned it to a tree. Right then is when the huge rocks hit the water, trees started snapping and I turned around to the scream. This is a true story. I fished this small lake several times before this happened but have never returned. My memory will never forget this spot on the lake, the snake, the scream, the creature. It has been over twenty years. Story has always been told the same. I told this story to a BFRO rep. about four years ago and I think it was the guy who covers Jackson County, Illinois. I told him about the A41 lake and that he could find what he was looking for right there. He asked me to make a report on the site but I did not. Now after seeing this episode of Monsters and mysteries in America and the guy from the Murphysboro salvage yard describing the scream exactly I knew I had to come forward.

We were making our way back to the truck and were within 500 yards when I made another set of knocks wich was followed almost immediatly by a very loud and powerfull growl. My daughter immediatly looked at me and said what is that dad. Halving my 5 year old with me made me just want to get her to the truck asap. The power and intensity was really something, it reminded me of passing a snow plow on the road, just the power of it. The following summer a couple of things happened I think are related. In june me and my buddy who like to whitewater kayak went to the Shades, Pine Hills area to kayak due to some heavy rains and flooding,wich in Indiana is the only good runs we get. That day while standing along suger creek at our buddys cottage which is across from the spot Indian creek enters suger creek we were debating how safe Indian creek would be to run when for some reason a deer jumped into the water and tried to swim across, it did not make it and got sucked under a log jam under the covered bridge. That was our sign and we descided tomorrow would be a better idea. We met around 10:30 the next day and Kayaked Indian creek which was still running fast but safer. As we was leaving Indian creek and entering suger creek at the spot we were at the day before except on the other side, I noticed to my left along the cliff face was a stack of rocks about a foot and a half tall stacked right on top of each other.

The jeep was parked in a small grassy clearing used for camping and the two pits were appox 50 feet east of the jeep with the fence and tree line 10 to 20 feet beyond the pits. The trees were bare of cover and it was a bit overcast. I waited at the fence line and I kept an eye on the silhouette moving towards me. I called out once, twice with no reply. The thickness and number of trees and the overcast made it hard to see details of the silhouette. The silhouette moved past me and the only noise I heard was the slight crunching of leaves on the ground. Still not able to make out more then a silhouette and thinking this was the land owner or local, I called out again and waved at the silhouette. It was now approx 50 to 60 from me. A bit confused and thinking that the silhouette did not hear me nor saw me, I moved down the fence line to a small opening cut in the tress for a power line. I stood at the fence waiting, and the silhouette moved into the opening. I called out again and froze. The silhouette also froze and turned its head towards me.

It was after sunset but not yet dark.  The temperature was in the mid 30's but the ground wasn't frozen and there were still patches of snow on the ground in places.  I came out of the woods, put my shotgun, heavy winter coat, and daypack in the trunk of my car and got inside my car to start it up when a movement to my left caught my eye. I will tell you what I saw and what I thought as I was seeing this happen.  This man/bigfoot came out of thick brush between the trees to my left on the opposite side of the road from where I was parked, maybe thirty five or forty yards down the road at an angle but it had to know that I was there or at least that my car was there. When I first saw this thing coming out of the thick brush the first thing I thought was, where in the heck did he come from....  Then, I thought, stupid guy, no hunter orange and then I began to notice strange things like he had no gun, and that he was the same color from head to toe, no hat, no hunter orange?  But then what I really noticed was that his arms were long, his hands were swinging at his knees and though he was taking large steps crossing the road very quickly but without running, he was just walking.  His arms were swinging wide like a British soldier marching but he didn't seem to be in any hurry and he completely ignored me like I wasn't there but he had to know that I was there.  He did not look over and kept his head looking straight ahead. He went into the woods on my side of the road (side I was parked on) and went down the hill and disappeared.  My eyes told me that I just saw a bigfoot but my brain and common sense was trying to dispute that.  His color was dark brown and I thought could that have been a man in a one piece Carhartt outfit or if he were a hiker lost wouldn't he just have stayed on the road rather than go down a steep hill when it was almost dark or if lost why didn't he ask me for help?  He was about six feet tall but very husky with his hands, body, feet, side of his head-face, all one color.  I actually couldn't see fur because the light was dim.  I could see the trees and tree trunks fine but not the bark because the tree trunks were silhoutetted and that's what I mean about not seeing the fur, it was all one shade of dark brown.  Now, all of this that I just told you took place in a minute or less.  Soon as it disappeared over the side of the hill I jumped out of my car, opened the trunk and loaded my shotgun (for self-defense only), put on my winter coat, and got my flashlight out of my day pack and walked to where I thought the thing went over the hill.  I wanted to check out what I just saw and was hoping to find a footprint in the ground or on a patch of snow and I went slowly back and forth, traversing this rather steep hill going a little deeper down as I moved back and forth.  There was a deep like gorge on the right side of the hill and I looked up towards the road and by now the ridge on top was just a slither of gray and looking over my shoulder I realized this was not too smart, it was pitch black below me and I got a little scared and hiked back up to the road and to my car as fast as I could.  I placed my shotgun back in the case along with my heavy coat putting them in the truck and then I drove up and down the main forest road to see if there were any cars parked off on the sides or if there were anyone walking, I saw nothing.  I drove to the valley road where I thought this thing would eventually come out at the bottom of the hill into farm fields and I drove back to the end of this valley and back hoping to see something but saw nothing.  I have been wanting to make a report of what I saw and have told my wife, children, teenage granddaughters, brother, and two close hunting buddies, but have always been hesitant to make a report.  The truth is, though I am sure what I saw wasn't a man I can't prove it wasn't a man dressed up in a suit but who would be that stupid especially during hunting season. I can't say positively that it was a bigfoot but that is what my eyes saw.  Logic says \\\"no\\\", my eyes say, \\\"yes\\\" and that's my report the best that I can remember it.

I've wanted to discuss the older incident for quite some time but have hesitated to do so.  The second incident occurred March 16, 2009 and unnerved me enough to go ahead with these reports. (Note: for the older incident, please see ) This occurred on the western outskirts of Bloomington, IN.  While this happened in a subdivision, it is an isolated subdivision surrounded by fields, small growth forest and quarries.  Only a few miles further west the forestation thickens and several creeks and streams run through this area.  Deer are seen here frequently, as well as other game animals and occasionally turkeys. My girlfriend and I arrived at her parents' home in this neighborhood.  We exited the car and I immediately heard a very, very odd sound.  They were short moans, about 2 seconds apart at first, then many different timing variations.  But they seemed to come consistently in groups of 4, with each call lasting between 2-10 seconds.  After my initial encounters with what I came to believe was a Bigfoot, I found the BFRO site and listened to all the sounds, viewed all the images, read as many reports as I could -- I became an avid fan of the investigation and the science behind the creature.  I recognized this sound as similar to the Ohio moans but shorter in duration.  I'll have to listen to them again to make certain, but these were not anything like the whoops, screams or \\\"bionic bird calls\\\" that I've heard.  These were definitely loud, powerful, reverberating moans.  I have heard owls call out responses to environmental noises and also heard coyotes howling many times -- you can tell the difference based on the sheer power of the tones.  This was not an owl or coyote.  My girlfriend likened it to a very sick or injured cow -- but none are near this location.  She had heard sick cows before and this was not a sick cow mooing -- it was, again, definitely a moaning sound. We listened for 2 or 3 minutes then went inside.  She immediately went out the back door to listen, as she knew that I would want to do so.  We listened another few minutes and I decided to try and call back.  I first tried mimicking the moan and, not receiving a response, I tried to make a whoop sound as best I could.  The moaning stopped immediately.  Off to our right, about 200 yards away in a stand of trees, I could see a few trees visibly shake -- not wiggle in the wind but shake like an elephant had just moved between them.  I heard no noises like breathing, growling, grumbling, footfalls or otherwise.  However, at that moment, off to our right a dog started barking ferociously and we could see it backing up closer to its house.  This continued down the row of houses -- the dog would bark, growl then back up -- and it was in succession, getting closer to us.  I was very scared at this point as, even if it was not a Bigfoot, I'd apparently gotten its attention and it was moving towards us.  After passing the barking dog 3 houses away on our right, the dogs silenced and everything fell silent.  At that moment, I saw some movement out in the field to the west of the trees, about 50 feet beyond the stand of trees.  I heard a couple of quick moans then something streaked across the field from north to south.  To describe what I could see is difficult.  The moon and star light was enough that I could see a shape and a grayish color.  The figure was definitely on two legs. It was running very fast but the legs were taking very large strides while the body appeared to be kept almost parallel to the group, like you would run if someone were shooting at you.  The figure did not appear to be much taller than a normal person though it did seem (again, in poor lighting conditions) to be stockier than an average man.  The shoulders were much larger than the waist and the legs were long and appeared lean but strong.  The trunk of the being was too blurry to see any detail.  The creature took 4-5 long and power strides and dropped to the ground behind what appeared to be a bush or clump of weeds.  At that point, I felt nervous enough that we went inside.  I peeked out several more times in the ensuing few minutes and saw nothing.  I had been kicking myself about not having a camera, but the lighting was so poor and the movement so fast that an indistinct gray blur is all that would have turned out.  About 10 minutes after all of this ended, we heard the sound of metal clanking and being broken.  My girlfriend advised that there was lawn furniture further out in the field and it sounded, to her, like someone was throwing or breaking it.  I looked a little later and yes, in fact, the lawn furniture had been strew about when it had been sitting upright when we arrived home (I didn't see this as I am not all that familiar with the setting -- she noticed it was upright because she knew what/where to look at).  There were no storms, wind or other natural disturbances in the area that night, though I cannot preclude a common animal, such as a deer, may have run through the area and knocked everything over.  Other than being on edge the rest of the evening, waiting for something to happen, nothing else was noted. In talking with her further about this, I learned that the neighborhood is aware of this creature.  They have nicknamed it \\\"The Troll\\\" and generally give it a wide berth and respect it.  They say it lives in a sinkhole further out west, but I'm not certain exactly where.  I've asked her family to take me out to the sinkhole so I can take a look but have not made the trip yet.  Sightings of this creature are seasonal, though I don't know which seasons/time frames it is commonly present in. This second sighting felt a little more threatening, or at least I had the vibe that the situation was not safe or controlled (from either side -- mine or the creature).  I got the distinct impression that this was a juvenile calling out and when he got an unexpected response, he came to investigate, chest puffed out and ready to rock.  But he quickly backed off and instead sought to either hide or make his way across the field and away from us.  When we went inside, I think he showed his displeasure by trashing the lawn furniture.  I could easily be completely wrong in my assessment, but those were the feelings I got from how things played out.\", \"location_details\": \"Bloomington location removed per witness\", \"county\": \"Monroe County\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"season\": \"Spring\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 25658.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"hey i just happened to stumble upon this website. last year october 24 2009, me, my friend, and his dad where waterfowl hunting on monroe lake, in monroe county, we were set up on a peninsula on the farthest point with two small bays behind us to our right and left. we have gone to the peninsula before multiple times to waterfowl hunt.and we went out early morning when it was still dark. everything was normal. no birds flying though. so we were just stitting on our colapsable chairs facing the water looking by this time it was about 5 mins. after sunrise so still pretty dark. it was my friend on my right and his dad on my left, since we were shooting shot guns they were loud so i had ear plugs in. and then this extremely loud roar/ moan comes from the right bay. the moment i heard it i though it was a dog.. but it kept going and got even louder and then dropped to a very low moan/ growl . the roar / moan lasted about 8 to 10 seconds, keep in mind i had ear plugs in and i still heard that noise crystal clear. we all three stood up and just stood facing the other side of the right bay and didnt see anything ( only a beaver in the middle of the bay. the bay was about 60 yards across. me and my friend were terrified and had no idea what made that noise. not paying attention to hunting we stood there scared to death. now i need to ephasize the loudness of the roar it was extrememly extremely loud. and i looked over to my friend about 2 mins after the first noise. and i said man i wish we could hear it again. what do you know . we hear it again but it sounded much farther away. and sounded the exact same as the first noise. we were shocked . now us being hunters we knew just about any indiana wildlife there is to know about and all the noises they make. and what we heard that day was nothing like i have ever heard in my life. so then not hunting any longer we remainded standing there facing the right bay listening. we dont hear anything else. we didnt see and birds flying that whole morning so about 12 noon we pack up and start to walk back to where our car was parked about a 5 min walk with the gear so about 300 yards away. the path we took that morning was on the bank of the right bay... as you would think we kept our shot guns loaded on our walk back to the car.we pack up and get on our way. the spot we where in was not very populated at all there was a dnr check station about a mile down the road and some houses on the windie road back to bloomington. now if you know any thing about monroe are is how hilly it is and the questions we kept asking our selves was , what was that noise...? and how could if have traveled so quick to hear agian so far away? our gueses we made where - bared owl?, mule deer? dog? some sort of bear..? but we all quickly ruled out of the those. the closest was the dog. but the roar/ moan was so loud and the last 3 sec dropped to a low low growl/ mumble and no dog could make that loud of a howl of any sort. it wasnt till about half way through the 2 hour drive home to indianapolis. that my friends dad said it could have been some college kids joking around  since it was around halloweenwith a mega phone. but then we said why would college kids be up at 630 go deep into monroe forest find 3 hunters in complete camoflauge and make that noise. just none of our guesses were making sinse with that noise we heard. its not till we got back to my friends house and got on the computer and immedialely started looking up moans and roars. none matched we tried every animal noise in indiana and then we were on youtube and a video popped up . the title said bigfoot noises and pictures . thats when me and my friend look at each other and said oh my god . quickly clicking on the video a picture of so called \\\"big foot' showed up and then a audio started. the noise on the video was EXACTILY the same noise we hear that morning hunting. then we go to another bigfoot recording . it was very similiar to what we heard, and another and another and all the videos we listnend to matched up just right with what we heard or very close to what we heard. now before this incedent we would always make fun of the bigfoot tv shows and the people who believe in big foot. but i do not  make fun of that any more. me and my friend still talk about it today about what we heard on october 22 2009. me and my friend are both believers of big foot. or not big foot but some unknown creature that is out there and no one can seem to pin point what it is so they use the name \\\"bigfoot\\\" we never did go back to the peninsula on monroe lake that hunting year. but we did go back in october again this year to the same exact spot. we didnt hear anything but that time we didnt go back to the spot across the right bay to where we heard it and found no sign of anything out of the ordianry. it still remains a mystery of could have made that noise but as of now me and my friend both say what we heard was bigfoot. all i have said is completely true. i hope this was worth reading if you have any questions or comments on this my email is [removed] ( i would actually like if you did respond to this so i can hear what you guys have to say about my story) thanks\", \"location_details\": \"back on windie roads if not fimiliar with the area it will be very dificult to find.\", \"county\": \"Monroe County\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": \"Report 28861: Loud, early morning vocalizations heard by duck hunters near Lake Monroe\", \"latitude\": 39.02502, \"longitude\": -86.49139, \"date\": \"2009-10-22\", \"number\": 28861.0, \"classification\": \"Class B\", \"geohash\": \"dnfqpb6chw\", \"temperature_high\": 67.45, \"temperature_mid\": 63.17, \"temperature_low\": 58.89, \"dew_point\": 51.86, \"humidity\": 0.79, \"cloud_cover\": 0.3, \"moon_phase\": 0.15, \"precip_intensity\": 0.001, \"precip_probability\": 0.83, \"precip_type\": \"rain\", \"pressure\": 1014.28, \"summary\": \"Rain overnight.\", \"uv_index\": 4.0, \"visibility\": 9.65, \"wind_bearing\": 140.0, \"wind_speed\": 1.02, \"location\": \"POINT(-86.49139 39.02502)\"}, {\"observed\": \"I have had two possible \\\"Bigfoot related\\\" incidents. I've wanted to discuss the older incident for quite some time but have hesitated to do so. The second incident occurred March 16, 2009 and unnerved me enough to go ahead with these reports. (Note: see for the more recent incident) The first incident occurred in approximately August of either 1997 or 1998, I can't recall offhand the exact year any longer. This happened on private land near Campbellsburg, IN. The terrain of this private land is moderate hardwood forest, heavy leaf litter and only mildly rugged. There are several caves (all of them quite extensive as privately held cave systems go). There is also a valley with a small creek and a disused cabin. We had two separate incidents. On the first night we camped at the top of the valley so we could look down on the cabin and creek, mainly because it was a very pretty overlook and we could see the stars. After dinner and a couple of beers (no one was intoxicated by any means), one by one we headed off to use the restroom downwind and far away from camp. On one side of camp was the valley and on the other side was a very steep incline leading down to a privately owned field that no one could trespass without risking at least arrest, if not worse. As I started out into the forest to relieve myself, I heard the distinct sounds of someone walking purposefully up this steep incline. The footfalls were heavy enough to be heard distinctly apart from the shuffling of leaf litter. I squatted down, thinking it was the adjacent property owner coming over to complain about noise or trying to chase us off (even though we had full permission to use this property). The footfalls stopped at the top of the incline and then, whoever this was, took off running full bore into the deeper parts of the forest. The footfalls were very distinctly bipedal and NOT the rapid sound of deer footfalls. I didn't know who this may be so I called out to them. The running continued and no response was given. After I did my business, I went back to camp and the other persons agreed they heard the footfalls and thought it was me. None of us saw anything at that time. About 2 hours later we heard a VERY loud scream, starting at a low pitch and rapidly increasing to a piercing screech. We heard this only once and it caused the forest sounds to stop -- about 2-3 minutes later the normal forest sounds started again. We then decided to turn in for the night -- we had been creeped out enough. We slept in a van on our trips so we climbed into the van and fell asleep. About 2 or 3 AM, one of the other persons on the trip yelled out and woke us all up. He'd awakened to see a large arm (he never specified anything other than it was very large and the hand was large and dark) reaching in the van window and taking food out of the front seat. We looked and the food was partially missing, the remainder spilled about the seat and floorboard. I can't say for sure if he was dreaming, hallucinating or just spooked from earlier and mistook a raccoon for an arm or something like that. Something had disturbed the food but I don't know what it specifically was -- though I personally made the connection to our \\\"visitor\\\" from earlier visiting the camp. No tracks were found in camp but we could see where something large had ascended the steep incline the night before when we investigated the next morning. These were just gouges in the hillside and disturbances in the leaf litter, nothing more. But whatever or whoever came up that incline had marched right up and never hesitated. We didn't have tools to measure, photograph or record what we saw as we didn't think it was \\\"bigfoot\\\" but rather an animal or the other property owner at that point. We camped in the valley for the remainder of the trip without incident. We returned about a year later. We decided that we'd camp in the valley for the trip -- it was creepy on top of the hill plus we were still thinking the adjacent property owner would be angry again at us being up there with a bonfire and making noise at night. We had 3 uneventful nights in the valley. The fourth night was different -- other than the noise of the stream, the normal \\\"night sounds\\\" were generally absent, except for the occasional owl calls or other sporadic noises. It was quite eerie that night. We went to bed around 1AM (this time we were camping in tents and not in the van). About one hour later, we heard the familiar footfalls, this time descending the valley wall on the opposite side of the creek. There would 2 or 3 footfalls, a sliding sound then 20-30 seconds of silence. This process repeated until (we assumed) the person reached the edge of the creek opposite us. After what seemed like an eternity, the person crossed the creek very slowly -- we could hear gentle splashes with each step. Once in our camp, we could hear shuffling sounds. Our fire had gone out, so we could not see anything through the tent walls. None of us really cared to confront whoever or whatever was visiting. After about 30 minutes of shuffling, our cooler was forcefully knocked to the ground. Silence followed and we all fell back asleep. I awoke sometime later to the sound of someone approaching the tent. As I looked up through the rainfly, a head appeared and looked down at me. As we were under the tree canopy, the lighting was very poor. I could see that the head was very large, there was coarse hair on top and sticking out to the sides in places, but the face was in shadow. At that point I gasped and the head quickly moved out of view. I could hear it cross the creek and head up the hill and it was gone. I mentioned this to the guys the next morning and none of them noticed it return for the second visit but me. We had no further disturbance. Neither time did I feel \\\"threatened\\\" or any negative feelings other than the fear of encountering an unknown visitor, whether human or otherwise. But the head looking in the tent, and the stealthiness of the visitor, clued me in that this was not a \\\"man\\\" looking to scare us but rather likely a startled Bigfoot (the first encounter) and then an inquisitive Bigfoot (second encounter). I poked around quite a bit on the property and didn't see any obvious sign of a large animal, but there were lots of deer and the disused cabin had several bedding areas in it. Something or someone had bedded down there many times in the past, but the areas looked disused as well. Also note these bedding areas were on both the first and second floors of the building.\", \"location_details\": \"near North Cave River Valley Rd and West Cave River Valley Road\", \"county\": \"Washington County\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"season\": \"Summer\", \"title\": \"Report 25793: Campers have campsite visitor on two separate occasions near Campbellsburg\", \"latitude\": 38.6899, \"longitude\": -86.25349, \"date\": \"1997-08-01\", \"number\": 25793.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": \"dnfsj721h0\", \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": \"POINT(-86.25349 38.6899)\"}, {\"observed\": \"My sighting of what I believe to have been a sasquatch was quite brief, though I did get a decent look.

It lies northwest of Louisville, KY and east of Paoli Peaks, IN, a fairly well known ski resort town. I often wondered about the things they say they have seen and heard in the woods. They live about 3/4 of a mile back off the road in a trailer in the middle of a thick woods with alot of tall cedar and pine trees oaks and walnut trees also. the woods is heavy with alot of undergrowth and alot of sink holes and caves.

I have been hunting since I was 10 years old and have been hunting by myself since I was 13. My friend and I were picked for a special bow deer hunt in southern Indiana, Jefferson Proving Grounds. I had set up my tree stand along a fire break where I could see both, the opening and the wood line ahead of me. I had observed several deer around my stand about 12:30 that day and I took a shot at one of them. I tracked the deer across the fire break and into the woods where I lost his trail because of the dense briars and rose bushes. I could hardly walk through the stuff so after about 30 minutes I returned to my stand. Throughout the afternoon I watched the air force do practice runs over a restricted bombing area not far from where I was hunting. Later that evening when things had finally quieted down I heard some howling off in the distance. I figured that it was a pack of coyotes. About 5 minutes after they quieted down I began hearing some noise coming toward me from the deep woods. I thought that it was a deer running from the coyotes. I first saw it about 50 yards out coming toward me. It was about dark and as any hunter knows, thats the best time to see and shot a deer. I was ready and watching for an opening. When I had my first opening to get a shot I noticed that it was not a deer, but appeared to be a hunter. I watched as the figure ran across the opening through the brush to a second opening and then to a third opening where it crossed the fire break and then back into the woods behind me. I thought that it was odd because I have never seen a hunter dumb enough to run through   the wood during the prime hunting time. What was even more scary was the fact that it had taken me 10 minutes to walk through the same brush that this thing had run through in 20 seconds. It was completely black from head to toe and had a hump shape on its back. It stood about 6 foot 6 inches. The reason I can say that is because im 6'1\\\" and this thing was bigger than I am. I waited in my stand for a few minutes and then I got down and walked \\\"fast\\\" back to my truck. I met my buddy who was over the hill about 500 yards and he said that he heard whatever it was going through the brush but never saw it. I told him that it was a Big Foot and he laughted at me until he could see how serious I was about the thing. We asked at the checkout center if anyone else was hunting in the area and they said that we were the only hunters in that area and the two areas around that.\", \"location_details\": \"Near Jefferson Proving Grounds.\", \"county\": \"Jefferson County\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"season\": \"Fall\", \"title\": null, \"latitude\": null, \"longitude\": null, \"date\": null, \"number\": 1696.0, \"classification\": \"Class A\", \"geohash\": null, \"temperature_high\": null, \"temperature_mid\": null, \"temperature_low\": null, \"dew_point\": null, \"humidity\": null, \"cloud_cover\": null, \"moon_phase\": null, \"precip_intensity\": null, \"precip_probability\": null, \"precip_type\": null, \"pressure\": null, \"summary\": null, \"uv_index\": null, \"visibility\": null, \"wind_bearing\": null, \"wind_speed\": null, \"location\": null}, {\"observed\": \"It was last summer July 1998.
